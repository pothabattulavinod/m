{\an8}VISAKHAPATNAM
2013

00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:04.083
Silence!

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.125
Silence!

00:01:05.208 --> 00:01:06.750
- Silence!
- Greetings, sir!

00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:13.958
Case No. 16/2013.

00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:17.000
State represented by
Bheemunipatnam Police Station

00:01:17.083 --> 00:01:20.125
vs. Mettu Chandrasekhar, alias Chandu.

00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.583
The defense's closing statement.

00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:31.791
Considering the young age of the accused,

00:01:31.875 --> 00:01:33.958
and the promising future
he has ahead of him,

00:01:34.041 --> 00:01:37.416
I urge the Court to exercise compassion
in its judgment.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.375
That's all, Your Honor.

00:01:41.125 --> 00:01:43.458
The prosecution's evidence in this case,

00:01:43.541 --> 00:01:46.125
witnesses, and defense arguments

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.666
have been examined thoroughly.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.458
Taking everything into consideration,

00:01:49.541 --> 00:01:53.000
the final judgment of this case
will be pronounced in the open court,

00:01:53.125 --> 00:01:58.500
at the next hearing,
dated 29th July 2013 at 10 a.m.

00:02:04.541 --> 00:02:06.208
What could be the punishment for this boy?

00:02:06.291 --> 00:02:09.000
Damu seems determined to ensure
a minimum punishment of 14 years.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.916
Isn't the judge a good guy?

00:02:11.708 --> 00:02:13.375
I think he'd give him ten years.

00:02:13.625 --> 00:02:14.875
What's this, brother?

00:02:15.208 --> 00:02:17.291
One says ten years
and another says fourteen.

00:02:17.458 --> 00:02:19.041
I don't get it.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.458
What's the outcome
of the trial today, bro?

00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:23.875
The final judgment will be delivered
next Monday.

00:02:24.833 --> 00:02:25.791
Final judgment?

00:02:26.166 --> 00:02:27.375
What's the case about, bro?

00:02:27.458 --> 00:02:28.916
The POCSO case, brother.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.541
- Is it about the Tagarapuvalasa girl?
- That's right.

00:02:32.375 --> 00:02:34.791
I've heard about it. Sounds difficult.

00:02:35.125 --> 00:02:36.708
My guy did nothing wrong, sir.

00:02:37.541 --> 00:02:39.750
There was a similar tough case
in Vijayawada.

00:02:39.833 --> 00:02:43.166
A senior lawyer named Mohan Rao
dealt with it nicely.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.166
Someone like him
should've handled your case.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.458
He could've been impactful.

00:02:48.041 --> 00:02:50.208
Could you please share
Mr. Mohan Rao's number, sir?

00:02:50.291 --> 00:02:52.041
Hey, I was just being casual.

00:02:52.166 --> 00:02:56.250
With the judgment in just four days,
what can he do about this case?

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.666
This wouldn't work out.

00:02:57.791 --> 00:02:59.958
What would they do staying in Vizag?

00:03:00.041 --> 00:03:02.375
Just give them his number. Let them try.

00:03:02.708 --> 00:03:04.708
I don't have Mr. Mohan Rao's number.

00:03:04.791 --> 00:03:07.708
My guy might have
his assistant Teja's number.

00:03:07.791 --> 00:03:09.041
I'll share it with you.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:19.708
Hold this, please.

00:03:24.625 --> 00:03:26.708
If we take on a case,
we will also be given a table.

00:03:26.791 --> 00:03:28.208
Then we can eat peacefully.

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:31.458
It means that even to eat peacefully here…

00:03:31.916 --> 00:03:33.208
we need a case.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.375
If you dream about getting cases,

00:03:38.458 --> 00:03:40.666
why are you wasting time
dishing out quotes?

00:03:41.208 --> 00:03:43.458
You'd be better off
trying elsewhere on your own.

00:03:44.125 --> 00:03:45.125
Hello.

00:03:45.583 --> 00:03:47.875
It's not that easy for a fresher
to get a case.

00:03:48.291 --> 00:03:51.583
Suppose you win a case
while working with Mr. Mohan Rao,

00:03:51.666 --> 00:03:53.583
you don't have to look for cases.

00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:55.291
Instead, cases would come to you.

00:04:00.166 --> 00:04:02.208
- Teja. The boss wants to see you.
- Boss?

00:04:11.291 --> 00:04:12.583
- Sir?
- Teja.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.833
Once you're done with lunch,
keep the 304A case bundle ready,

00:04:15.916 --> 00:04:18.083
- and ask Lahari to be there.
- Okay, sir.

00:04:18.166 --> 00:04:23.208
Also, take another date in the 498A case,
because the accused has not turned up.

00:04:23.333 --> 00:04:24.916
- I'll join you shortly.
- Okay, sir.

00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:26.833
Lahari.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.541
Quick with your lunch.
He wants you on the 304A case.

00:04:33.916 --> 00:04:35.375
Hello? Who's this?

00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:37.208
Sir, my name is Shanmukh Reddy.

00:04:37.291 --> 00:04:38.916
I'm calling from Vizag.

00:04:39.083 --> 00:04:41.791
We want to speak with Mr. Mohan Rao
regarding our case.

00:04:42.458 --> 00:04:44.125
Friday is the day after tomorrow, right?

00:04:44.875 --> 00:04:46.333
Be here by Friday evening.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.000
Saturday and Sunday are holidays.
He can discuss it with you in detail.

00:04:50.083 --> 00:04:52.458
- We will call you on Friday, sir.
- Okay.

00:04:54.041 --> 00:04:55.875
How is Friday viable for us, bro?

00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.416
You should've told him
the judgment is on Monday.

00:04:58.583 --> 00:05:00.666
If we do,
they'd ask us not to come at all.

00:05:01.875 --> 00:05:03.833
Everyone is arguing cases
and we're counting bundles.

00:05:03.916 --> 00:05:04.791
- Teja!
- Yes?

00:05:04.875 --> 00:05:07.166
I asked Mr. Murali from your office
to make a notary document.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.458
He said he'd send it with you.
Did you bring that?

00:05:09.541 --> 00:05:12.000
- He gave it to me, but I didn't bring it.
- Why?

00:05:12.083 --> 00:05:13.416
I don't touch notary documents.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.750
- Better find someone else to get it.
- Teja...

00:05:16.583 --> 00:05:18.750
There is a cross-examination
of our 304A case.

00:05:18.875 --> 00:05:21.958
- My boss is coming.
- My boss was discussing that.

00:05:22.041 --> 00:05:25.625
I just heard him asking why Mr. Mohan Rao
is not opting for a settlement.

00:05:25.708 --> 00:05:26.958
When I asked him that,

00:05:27.041 --> 00:05:29.083
- he asked me to mind my business.
- Listen.

00:05:29.166 --> 00:05:31.291
I don't get what questions
could be posed regarding this case.

00:05:31.375 --> 00:05:33.583
It's clear that the lorry driver
caused the accident.

00:05:33.666 --> 00:05:34.791
Hey, Koti!

00:05:35.416 --> 00:05:38.083
My boss would never take up a case
if he can't win it.

00:05:38.166 --> 00:05:42.041
Mr. Mohan Rao, I don't have the right
to tell you not to argue a case.

00:05:42.125 --> 00:05:44.083
But the other party
has suffered a loss of life.

00:05:44.333 --> 00:05:45.416
Please show some kindness.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.708
Kindness has nothing to do
with justice, Your Honor.

00:05:48.416 --> 00:05:50.208
When we were in law college,

00:05:50.708 --> 00:05:54.083
we were told that there is no need to
remove shoes outside the court hall,

00:05:54.458 --> 00:05:57.625
but kindness, pity, and compassion
should definitely be left outside.

00:05:58.041 --> 00:05:59.333
That holds true even now.

00:05:59.916 --> 00:06:03.833
Your Honor, if you please allow me,
I'll start with my cross-examination.

00:06:04.458 --> 00:06:05.666
- Proceed.
- Thank you.

00:06:08.375 --> 00:06:09.541
Salutations, sir.

00:06:09.666 --> 00:06:11.958
What was your relationship
with the late Venkata Ramana?

00:06:12.041 --> 00:06:14.541
- He was my father, sir.
- Please tell us what happened to him.

00:06:14.625 --> 00:06:17.250
He died when he was hit by a lorry
while crossing the road.

00:06:17.375 --> 00:06:19.666
Shall I tell you what questions
my boss is going to ask?

00:06:19.833 --> 00:06:21.375
At the site of the accident...

00:06:21.458 --> 00:06:22.833
Is there a signboard...

00:06:22.916 --> 00:06:24.541
With your village's name on it?

00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:26.958
I mean,

00:06:27.041 --> 00:06:31.250
is there a board with your
village name Rayapadu and an arrow mark?

00:06:31.333 --> 00:06:32.166
No, sir.

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:33.166
At that location,

00:06:33.833 --> 00:06:36.041
are there any zebra crossing lines?

00:06:36.166 --> 00:06:40.666
I mean, white lines on the road,
indicating you can cross the road.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.083
Are there any such lines?

00:06:42.166 --> 00:06:43.166
Nothing like that.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:44.125
Driver…

00:06:44.208 --> 00:06:45.791
Was he drunk driving?

00:06:45.875 --> 00:06:48.041
- No, sir.
- What mistake did he commit, then?

00:06:49.583 --> 00:06:50.916
Why did you even file this case?

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.583
He was speeding and hit my dad.

00:06:52.666 --> 00:06:55.625
Your Honor, the speed limit
on that highway is 100 kmph.

00:06:55.791 --> 00:06:57.625
But the lorry speed was at 110 kmph.

00:06:57.708 --> 00:07:00.250
So the police filed an FIR
under section 304A,

00:07:00.333 --> 00:07:03.166
and charged the driver
with negligent driving.

00:07:03.333 --> 00:07:05.083
When the lorry was seized...

00:07:05.208 --> 00:07:08.291
Its cargo weight was noted as 8.2 tons

00:07:08.416 --> 00:07:10.958
by the same police
in their final declaration.

00:07:11.375 --> 00:07:17.708
But, according to the calculations of
Automotive Research Association of India,

00:07:17.916 --> 00:07:21.791
the maximum speed a lorry
with 8.2 tons of cargo can go...

00:07:21.875 --> 00:07:22.875
Is 80 kmph.

00:07:23.083 --> 00:07:26.083
So, there was no chance of
excessive speeding.

00:07:26.708 --> 00:07:29.041
To reduce the existing speed,

00:07:29.166 --> 00:07:33.208
there were no signboards
or zebra crossing lines.

00:07:33.416 --> 00:07:38.416
Crossing the highway without
any precautionary measures is a mistake.

00:07:39.041 --> 00:07:42.708
Therefore, negligently and irresponsibly,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.333
without following road safety rules,

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.416
Venkata Ramana made a mistake.

00:07:47.708 --> 00:07:49.208
Why should the lorry driver...

00:07:49.291 --> 00:07:52.458
Pay compensation?
Why should he settle out of court?

00:07:54.125 --> 00:07:57.083
We can continue the case
if the prosecution can answer this.

00:07:57.166 --> 00:08:00.583
Otherwise, I request the Honorable Court
to dismiss the case right here

00:08:00.666 --> 00:08:03.500
and hand over the seized vehicle
to the driver with immediate effect.

00:08:03.666 --> 00:08:04.791
Any questions?

00:08:06.458 --> 00:08:07.291
No, Your Honor.

00:08:07.375 --> 00:08:10.625
The prosecution has failed
to prove section 304A.

00:08:10.708 --> 00:08:13.500
- Hence, the case is dismissed.
- How?

00:08:13.708 --> 00:08:14.708
Thank you, My Lord.

00:08:14.791 --> 00:08:17.375
You're smart enough to guess
how your boss will handle a case.

00:08:17.458 --> 00:08:18.791
You've been with him for three years.

00:08:18.875 --> 00:08:20.625
Why hasn't he given you a single case?

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.958
Oh God! Even you are asking this question.

00:08:24.041 --> 00:08:25.875
- I mean--
- He is asking the right thing.

00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:26.958
You tell me one thing.

00:08:27.041 --> 00:08:29.000
If he'd given me today's case

00:08:29.125 --> 00:08:31.208
I would've made
the same argument, right?

00:08:31.416 --> 00:08:32.708
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah!

00:08:35.291 --> 00:08:38.791
Who knows? He's probably
waiting for me to ask for it.

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:42.750
We just received a land dispute case.

00:08:42.833 --> 00:08:44.833
I will ask him to give me that case.

00:08:45.208 --> 00:08:48.291
Will you let me know
when he's in a good mood in his chamber?

00:08:48.541 --> 00:08:50.333
- You'll message me, won't you?
- I will.

00:08:51.375 --> 00:08:53.625
This is a land dispute case.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.208
The hearing is due next week.
Who can take this up?

00:08:57.583 --> 00:09:00.291
Murali, what cases
are you handling currently?

00:09:00.375 --> 00:09:04.125
A check bounce case, a family court case,
a land dispute and a 460 case.

00:09:05.583 --> 00:09:06.958
- Ramana, what about you?
- Sir!

00:09:07.041 --> 00:09:10.791
One eve-teasing case,
one financial fraud and theft case, sir.

00:09:11.875 --> 00:09:13.125
- Krishnaveni?
- Sir…

00:09:13.208 --> 00:09:15.791
You are very busy
with the rape case hearings, right?

00:09:15.875 --> 00:09:16.833
That's right, sir.

00:09:23.791 --> 00:09:25.708
I'll take this case up myself. Carry on.

00:09:34.041 --> 00:09:35.333
LAHARI: COME IN

00:09:37.041 --> 00:09:39.083
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes?

00:09:39.625 --> 00:09:41.541
Sir, I would like to individually…

00:09:42.375 --> 00:09:44.291
handle a case.

00:09:44.458 --> 00:09:45.666
If you're okay with it,

00:09:45.916 --> 00:09:48.125
I'd like to take up
that land dispute case.

00:09:49.166 --> 00:09:52.333
I don't have any problem assigning you
an individual case, Teja.

00:09:52.416 --> 00:09:53.333
I'll be happy to.

00:09:53.833 --> 00:09:57.375
But, before that,
I've got a question for you.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.291
I'll give you the case
if you give me the right answer.

00:10:02.541 --> 00:10:04.041
- Please go ahead, sir.
- Listen!

00:10:04.708 --> 00:10:07.458
A train is running on a track.

00:10:07.833 --> 00:10:09.541
There is a man on the same track.

00:10:09.791 --> 00:10:12.583
You're standing
near the track-changing lever.

00:10:13.583 --> 00:10:15.500
If you pull the lever,

00:10:15.708 --> 00:10:17.916
the train will shift to another track.

00:10:18.708 --> 00:10:20.833
There are five people on that other track.

00:10:22.583 --> 00:10:23.416
They'll all die.

00:10:23.916 --> 00:10:25.833
If you don't pull the lever,

00:10:26.458 --> 00:10:27.916
only one will die.

00:10:28.625 --> 00:10:29.541
So…

00:10:30.291 --> 00:10:31.208
Tell me.

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:33.458
Will you save one guy?

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:35.291
Or will you save five people?

00:10:35.583 --> 00:10:39.333
Sir, the lives of five people are
more important than that of one person.

00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.541
So, I'll save those five.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.791
What's up with you, son?

00:10:56.875 --> 00:10:58.958
If you're worried
that your son will end up

00:10:59.041 --> 00:11:01.166
handling only notary cases
like your husband,

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:02.208
you may forget it.

00:11:02.291 --> 00:11:03.791
Your son is set to be a lawyer soon!

00:11:03.875 --> 00:11:06.125
Why? Is your Mohan Rao giving you a case?

00:11:06.208 --> 00:11:07.291
He almost did.

00:11:07.458 --> 00:11:08.958
What do you mean by "almost"?

00:11:09.041 --> 00:11:10.208
He asked me a question

00:11:10.458 --> 00:11:11.791
and asked me to answer it.

00:11:11.875 --> 00:11:14.208
Your intelligent son
answered it in a jiffy.

00:11:14.458 --> 00:11:15.791
He'll give me the case tomorrow.

00:11:16.166 --> 00:11:17.083
Very nice.

00:11:17.375 --> 00:11:19.416
- Did you eat?
- I ate just now. Did you?

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:20.500
I ate, son.

00:11:20.875 --> 00:11:22.041
COURTHOUSE
VIJAYAWADA

00:11:23.458 --> 00:11:25.083
Sir. I wanted to ask about the case.

00:11:25.166 --> 00:11:27.875
You wanted to kill one guy
and save five people, right?

00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:28.833
Yes sir.

00:11:28.916 --> 00:11:31.125
Actually, those five are
antisocial elements.

00:11:31.458 --> 00:11:33.666
They've killed a few people.
The case is still on.

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:35.583
They'll surely be punished.

00:11:35.875 --> 00:11:36.875
Now, tell me.

00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.041
Will you save those five or the one?

00:11:40.125 --> 00:11:44.875
Sir, one innocent civilian life is
more important than those five criminals.

00:11:45.625 --> 00:11:48.333
So, I'll kill those five
and save the civilian.

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:51.500
Let's go.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.375
Get the copy from the clerk
and come to the office.

00:11:58.375 --> 00:11:59.666
Sir, actually…

00:12:01.791 --> 00:12:03.666
- That case…
- Case?

00:12:04.333 --> 00:12:06.708
You chose to kill
those five and save the one, right?

00:12:06.791 --> 00:12:09.041
- Yes, sir.
- There's a land with 600 families.

00:12:09.416 --> 00:12:13.708
These five killed the officers who were
giving away the land to a private group,

00:12:13.875 --> 00:12:16.416
and stopped those families
from losing their homes.

00:12:16.583 --> 00:12:19.875
Now, those families need
the support of these five, Teja.

00:12:21.125 --> 00:12:22.208
What will you do now?

00:12:22.291 --> 00:12:24.500
Will you save these five or the one?

00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.208
I'll kill the one
and save these five, sir.

00:12:39.416 --> 00:12:40.666
Sir. Excuse me, sir.

00:12:41.875 --> 00:12:44.708
Regarding that case…

00:12:44.791 --> 00:12:47.708
You said you'd save those five
and kill the one, right?

00:12:47.875 --> 00:12:50.416
Yes, sir. I feel that's right.

00:12:50.875 --> 00:12:51.875
Now…

00:12:52.458 --> 00:12:55.333
The land for which
these five became rebels,

00:12:55.416 --> 00:12:57.583
was, in fact, given to them
by that one man.

00:12:57.791 --> 00:12:59.000
He's their father, Teja.

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:01.333
Now tell me.

00:13:02.166 --> 00:13:03.625
Whom will you choose to save?

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:06.500
Think about it.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:12.833
{\an8}MOM

00:13:19.541 --> 00:13:21.541
- Mom!
- What's up, my son?

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:23.750
What's your Mohan Rao
saying about the case?

00:13:23.833 --> 00:13:24.875
Did he give it to you?

00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.458
- Not yet, Mom.
- It's all right.

00:13:26.541 --> 00:13:27.666
Did you eat something?

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:29.833
- Not yet. I will.
- Why do you sound sad?

00:13:29.916 --> 00:13:31.083
Nothing, Mom. I'm good.

00:13:31.375 --> 00:13:32.916
Did your Mohan Rao scold you?

00:13:34.416 --> 00:13:37.958
I now understand
why Dad is still doing notary services.

00:13:38.041 --> 00:13:38.958
What?

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:41.083
Nothing. I'll call you later.

00:13:41.208 --> 00:13:42.333
Hey! Teja!

00:13:46.916 --> 00:13:48.791
- Teja. Check who just came in.
- Sir.

00:13:51.708 --> 00:13:52.625
Yes?

00:13:52.833 --> 00:13:54.875
- We are here to meet Mr. Teja?
- That's me.

00:13:55.166 --> 00:13:58.000
- We are from Vizag.
- Oh! You called me, right?

00:13:58.083 --> 00:13:59.041
Have a seat.

00:14:00.208 --> 00:14:01.375
What's your case about?

00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.416
Oh! Is it an on-going case?

00:14:08.166 --> 00:14:09.208
Has the trial begun?

00:14:09.291 --> 00:14:11.125
The final judgment is on Monday.

00:14:12.166 --> 00:14:13.250
Final judgment?

00:14:13.791 --> 00:14:15.000
What's the case about?

00:14:16.875 --> 00:14:18.125
POCSO?

00:14:19.083 --> 00:14:20.083
Who is the accused?

00:14:20.166 --> 00:14:22.083
- He is like a brother to me.
- Where is he?

00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.125
- He is in remand, sir.
- Remand?

00:14:26.791 --> 00:14:29.500
Remand and the final judgment?
What are you saying?

00:14:29.625 --> 00:14:31.833
He has been in remand since his arrest.

00:14:32.791 --> 00:14:35.208
- He should've gotten bail.
- He didn't get it.

00:14:35.416 --> 00:14:37.750
He has been in remand
for the past 78 days.

00:14:41.583 --> 00:14:43.416
All right. Let me speak with my boss.

00:15:19.875 --> 00:15:21.458
Aren't you late for school, honey?

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:23.916
Hey!

00:15:24.708 --> 00:15:25.875
What, Dad?

00:15:31.375 --> 00:15:33.083
Hey! Did you see that?

00:15:33.708 --> 00:15:36.750
We're planning to send him to college
once he completes 12th grade

00:15:36.833 --> 00:15:39.625
but he's picking up new habits
and becoming a rogue.

00:15:41.166 --> 00:15:43.291
Always scrolling the internet!

00:15:44.708 --> 00:15:47.041
He's mixing with those idiots
and becoming one of them.

00:15:47.541 --> 00:15:48.916
Reddy should be blamed.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.291
He's married. He shouldn't be
hanging out with these kids.

00:15:51.375 --> 00:15:52.375
Shut up, Dad!

00:15:52.541 --> 00:15:54.041
What's this nonsense on New Year's Day?

00:15:54.125 --> 00:15:56.666
I'm doing my job and earning for myself.

00:15:56.916 --> 00:15:58.166
Great work you're doing.

00:15:58.250 --> 00:15:59.500
What's your job again?

00:15:59.875 --> 00:16:04.583
Hey! Going to work and going to the office
are two very different things.

00:16:05.833 --> 00:16:09.541
- How long will you do this nameless job?
- Don't speak about my job, Dad.

00:16:10.041 --> 00:16:12.125
We serve as secondary support
for corporate branches.

00:16:12.208 --> 00:16:13.458
It is called brand promotion.

00:16:13.666 --> 00:16:16.916
I buy my own clothes
and pay the motorbike loan myself.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.875
I don't depend on you for anything.
Why do you keep nagging me to study?

00:16:21.208 --> 00:16:22.083
Hey!

00:16:22.583 --> 00:16:24.166
I'll be a laborer all my life.

00:16:24.291 --> 00:16:25.958
No matter how much she studies,

00:16:26.041 --> 00:16:27.708
she'll leave our house after marriage.

00:16:28.416 --> 00:16:31.791
Without an educated person in the family,
this house will remain like this forever.

00:16:31.875 --> 00:16:34.291
Thinking that only educated people
become great is a myth.

00:16:34.375 --> 00:16:35.916
Take this land owner Surya Narayana.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.041
What did he study? Didn't he earn a lot?

00:16:38.125 --> 00:16:41.666
I was foolish to expect you
to become a good person.

00:16:46.083 --> 00:16:48.166
- Mom, I'm off.
- Be careful.

00:16:48.333 --> 00:16:49.583
- Mom?
- Yes?

00:16:49.666 --> 00:16:51.625
Is every day the same for your husband?

00:16:51.708 --> 00:16:53.500
- Always on my case!
- Son…

00:16:53.833 --> 00:16:56.875
I see nothing wrong
with my husband’s and son’s actions.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.583
- You guys sort it out.
- All right.

00:17:02.333 --> 00:17:05.375
- Where are the shampoo sachets?
- We probably ran out.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.958
Your husband has time to scold me
but not to buy shampoo sachets.

00:17:09.291 --> 00:17:10.458
Go and get them, son.

00:17:11.416 --> 00:17:12.875
Bro, give me shampoo sachets.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.291
- Are these the only greeting cards?
- Yes. Only those are available.

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:17.875
Hey, Chandu.

00:17:18.041 --> 00:17:20.625
- Happy New Year.
- Yeah. Happy New Year.

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:22.875
What's going to change now?
Just the calendars.

00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:25.375
- Characters won't change!
- Whatever!

00:17:30.875 --> 00:17:32.875
- Mom, is there no hot water?
- No, dear.

00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:34.708
Am I supposed to take a cold water bath?

00:17:34.791 --> 00:17:37.875
- Come on! You can boil it now.
- No time. I have an event to attend.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.666
At least iron my shirt.

00:17:39.875 --> 00:17:41.583
- What's this sudden surprise?
- Who's the guy?

00:17:41.666 --> 00:17:45.125
- He was acting smart near the shop.
- Who do you mean?

00:17:46.125 --> 00:17:47.916
- Oh! Brother Chandu.
- Brother?

00:17:48.291 --> 00:17:49.875
Oh! Is he that close?

00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:53.125
He is our neighbor
and helps us out sometimes.

00:17:53.791 --> 00:17:55.791
Oh! Do you have his number?

00:17:56.125 --> 00:17:57.125
Yes, I do.

00:17:57.291 --> 00:17:58.291
Let me have it.

00:17:58.500 --> 00:17:59.791
- What for?
- Just give it to me.

00:17:59.875 --> 00:18:01.250
- No.
- Give me, I say.

00:18:10.208 --> 00:18:13.250
When someone wished you
a Happy New Year,

00:18:13.333 --> 00:18:15.041
was it necessary to give such a reply?

00:18:15.125 --> 00:18:16.708
Hey! Who the hell are you?

00:18:17.833 --> 00:18:19.333
Why do you care?

00:18:19.541 --> 00:18:20.791
Why are you shirtless?

00:18:20.875 --> 00:18:23.000
Don't you have the habit
of wearing a shirt?

00:18:23.083 --> 00:18:25.500
Or do you think you've got
a body like Hrithik Roshan's?

00:18:25.583 --> 00:18:26.875
First, wear a shirt.

00:18:27.125 --> 00:18:28.833
- You can say punch lines later.
- Hey!

00:18:28.916 --> 00:18:30.333
Where are you calling from?

00:18:30.625 --> 00:18:32.541
- Oh my God! Hang up.
- Hey!

00:18:33.791 --> 00:18:36.041
Hey, why did you do this?

00:18:36.166 --> 00:18:38.500
What if he finds out
it was my friend who called him?

00:18:38.583 --> 00:18:39.583
How would he come to know?

00:18:39.666 --> 00:18:41.458
- Will you tell him?
- Why would I?

00:18:41.708 --> 00:18:43.125
Will you guys tell him?

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:44.500
- No.
- We will not.

00:18:44.583 --> 00:18:45.916
Why are you worried? Sit.

00:18:46.208 --> 00:18:48.750
Your house is 35 kilometers away.

00:18:48.875 --> 00:18:51.541
I live nearby. If something happens,
it will affect me first.

00:18:51.625 --> 00:18:52.708
Nothing will happen, dear.

00:18:52.791 --> 00:18:54.083
Go away.

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:01.916
Sit right.

00:19:08.708 --> 00:19:10.416
Did you put the soft drinks
in the fridge?

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:11.375
Yes, I did.

00:19:11.791 --> 00:19:14.125
- Brother, what soft drinks do you have?
- Thums Up!

00:19:14.208 --> 00:19:15.791
Hey! Your brother-in-law
doesn't like Thums Up.

00:19:15.875 --> 00:19:18.583
- Get Mirinda.
- Hey! Get Mirinda. Quickly!

00:19:18.666 --> 00:19:19.750
Okay, sir.

00:19:19.916 --> 00:19:22.666
More than my daughter's birthday,
your husband's tantrums became a big deal.

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:25.041
He stays four lanes away. We speak daily.

00:19:25.166 --> 00:19:27.208
Still, if he's coming to my home,
it's chaos.

00:19:27.291 --> 00:19:29.250
I work with him daily at the mill.

00:19:29.541 --> 00:19:31.291
Do I need to work for him even here?

00:19:31.416 --> 00:19:32.625
I don't get it.

00:19:33.666 --> 00:19:34.833
Brother-in-law is here.

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:40.375
Come, Brother-in-law.

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:43.333
- Has that cargo left?
- Yes, Brother-in-law. It has left.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.083
- Welcome, Son-in-law.
- Hello, Father-in-law? What's up?

00:19:47.291 --> 00:19:49.416
I got nothing.
You should be telling me.

00:19:49.958 --> 00:19:52.041
What's up with the land issue
in Chittivalasa?

00:19:52.125 --> 00:19:53.041
That one?

00:19:53.541 --> 00:19:56.208
That's not resolved yet.
I've informed our guys there.

00:19:56.291 --> 00:20:00.000
People who are wearing black coats
and khakis are waiting for us.

00:20:00.125 --> 00:20:02.375
I asked them to file
a complaint with the SI.

00:20:02.916 --> 00:20:05.958
I told them to meet
our lawyer Damu, if necessary.

00:20:06.083 --> 00:20:08.958
Why do you want to go to court
for this small issue?

00:20:09.041 --> 00:20:10.333
Of course you'd say that.

00:20:10.416 --> 00:20:13.375
You gave judgments in the past
as the village elder.

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:17.208
But now, we can get our things done
only through courts and police stations.

00:20:17.291 --> 00:20:19.000
Don't worry. I will take care of that.

00:20:19.083 --> 00:20:21.500
Your granddaughter
was born on the first of January.

00:20:21.583 --> 00:20:24.083
Where is the birthday girl?

00:20:24.166 --> 00:20:25.208
There she is.

00:20:29.125 --> 00:20:30.458
Come on. Let's cut the cake.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.583
Have mutton, Brother-in-law.

00:21:02.125 --> 00:21:03.291
Mutton?

00:21:04.541 --> 00:21:05.416
Mutton?

00:21:05.666 --> 00:21:07.750
- What happened, Brother-in-law?
- Shut up!

00:21:09.875 --> 00:21:11.583
You bloody idiot!

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:14.125
You are asking me what happened?

00:21:16.583 --> 00:21:18.333
Why would you dress a girl like that?

00:21:19.083 --> 00:21:20.333
Why is it sleeveless?

00:21:22.166 --> 00:21:25.958
What if my two daughters ask
for the same type of dress in the future?

00:21:27.166 --> 00:21:28.291
What should I do then?

00:21:33.583 --> 00:21:35.500
Our pride is reflected
in how our girls dress.

00:21:35.583 --> 00:21:38.250
Raising them well elevates
our respect in society.

00:21:39.208 --> 00:21:43.375
Learn how to dress your daughter properly,
then talk to me about eating mutton!

00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:45.791
Eat mutton, he says!

00:21:46.625 --> 00:21:49.500
Fine, he didn't realize what he brought.

00:21:50.375 --> 00:21:53.375
But what's wrong with you ladies?
Shouldn't you have corrected him?

00:21:54.583 --> 00:21:56.250
Why are you standing still?

00:21:56.541 --> 00:21:57.791
Change her dress first.

00:21:59.291 --> 00:22:00.166
Go inside, dear.

00:22:16.625 --> 00:22:19.000
It’s not easy to raise a daughter.

00:22:20.041 --> 00:22:21.125
Be careful.

00:22:23.291 --> 00:22:24.541
Serve the mutton now.

00:22:29.083 --> 00:22:32.458
Bro, someone called me this morning
and got me all riled up.

00:22:32.791 --> 00:22:34.916
- Let's settle scores with her.
- Who's that?

00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:50.333
Whoa! She hung up.

00:22:52.791 --> 00:22:54.041
Customer care.

00:22:56.458 --> 00:22:57.750
Who the hell is she?

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:00.500
Let me try again.

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:11.958
Jeez! She hung up again.

00:23:13.458 --> 00:23:14.958
It's the customer care again.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.541
Okay, Father-in-law.

00:23:29.708 --> 00:23:32.333
I couldn’t tell whose birthday it is.
Hers or his?

00:23:32.875 --> 00:23:33.916
What can we do?

00:23:34.416 --> 00:23:37.375
The head of this family believes
that man is the one in charge.

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:40.250
I wish Dad were alive.

00:23:43.208 --> 00:23:44.333
Who the hell is she?

00:23:45.083 --> 00:23:46.583
How dare she mess with me?

00:23:52.666 --> 00:23:54.083
Now she's calling me again.

00:23:55.208 --> 00:23:57.291
- Hello?
- Why are you calling me at night?

00:23:57.375 --> 00:24:00.916
- Acting smart?
- Why not? Were you with your husband?

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.708
Hey! Don't talk rubbish.

00:24:02.875 --> 00:24:05.291
What do you mean, "husband"?
Apologize to me first.

00:24:05.375 --> 00:24:07.250
Yeah, right!
Like I have nothing better to do.

00:24:07.333 --> 00:24:08.791
What else do you do then?

00:24:08.875 --> 00:24:10.250
How much is this phone?

00:24:10.333 --> 00:24:12.875
It's 2,500 rupees,
but we're giving it away for just 2,000!

00:24:12.958 --> 00:24:13.958
Why does it cost 2000?

00:24:14.041 --> 00:24:16.625
Why, you ask? This guy has the answer.

00:24:16.791 --> 00:24:18.416
- Hey, tell him.
- Come, I'll tell you.

00:24:18.541 --> 00:24:22.000
- Hello?
- Got it. You sell phones. Right?

00:24:22.458 --> 00:24:23.291
Of course!

00:24:23.375 --> 00:24:27.000
If you don't do well in school,
you'll end up in sales and marketing.

00:24:27.208 --> 00:24:29.416
Look at me speaking to you
about education.

00:24:29.583 --> 00:24:31.041
How stupid of me!

00:24:31.125 --> 00:24:34.125
Then why are you talking to me
instead of focusing on your studies?

00:24:34.208 --> 00:24:36.458
This says a lot about your education.

00:24:36.583 --> 00:24:40.250
Hey! Stop acting smart
and apologize to me twice.

00:24:40.333 --> 00:24:42.125
Apologize twice? Why would I?

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:43.958
If not you, then who?

00:24:44.041 --> 00:24:46.958
- Hey! Who the hell are you?
- Why do you care who I am?

00:24:47.125 --> 00:24:48.833
You said the wrong thing. So apologize.

00:24:48.916 --> 00:24:51.208
I said something wrong?
Who started it first?

00:24:51.291 --> 00:24:54.458
Is this how you speak to girls?
Where are your manners?

00:24:54.541 --> 00:24:55.416
{\an8}Manners?

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:58.666
{\an8}You’re out here telling some stranger
how to wear his clothes,

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:00.208
{\an8}and I’m the one lacking manners?

00:25:00.291 --> 00:25:02.708
If you walk around
like a clueless buffalo without a shirt,

00:25:02.833 --> 00:25:03.875
someone will call it out!

00:25:03.958 --> 00:25:06.041
Buffalo, huh? Who do you think you are?

00:25:06.125 --> 00:25:07.541
What does it matter to you?

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:10.958
- First apologize twice to me.
- What's with your two apologies?

00:25:11.833 --> 00:25:14.958
- Sir. Ordering beers?
- Yes. What beers do you have?

00:25:15.083 --> 00:25:18.000
We have all the usual brands
but there's a new one in the market.

00:25:18.333 --> 00:25:19.375
It's so smooth.

00:25:19.458 --> 00:25:22.083
As a part of the launch offer,
you'll get chips for free.

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:24.125
- Is that so? Then get me two beers.
- Yes.

00:25:24.375 --> 00:25:25.875
Bro! Two bottles on this table!

00:25:27.125 --> 00:25:28.208
- Bro.
- Hello?

00:25:28.541 --> 00:25:32.250
Since we’re selling so many beers,
do you think we can score two for free?

00:25:32.333 --> 00:25:33.541
- Yes, sure.
- Yeah.

00:25:33.791 --> 00:25:35.583
Yes, tell me. What's your problem?

00:25:35.708 --> 00:25:37.291
You sold phones earlier.

00:25:37.416 --> 00:25:40.000
I expected SIM cards or chargers
this time.

00:25:40.083 --> 00:25:43.791
- But beer? That's low! Yuck!
- What do you mean yuck?

00:25:43.875 --> 00:25:45.708
Why are you bothered with what I sell?

00:25:45.791 --> 00:25:49.166
Do you think selling beer is that easy?
Try selling it yourself, and you’ll know.

00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:52.083
You nasty idiot!
Why would I sell such a nasty thing?

00:25:52.166 --> 00:25:57.000
Nasty? Won't your dad be drinking it?
Go and tell him it's nasty.

00:25:57.083 --> 00:25:59.666
Hey! I'll hit you with slippers
if you talk about my dad!

00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:00.875
Good-for-nothing idiot!

00:26:00.958 --> 00:26:03.125
Why are you bothered about my dad?
Hang up!

00:26:03.208 --> 00:26:04.958
They why are you bothered about me?

00:26:05.458 --> 00:26:09.083
That guy over there is wondering what
to do if one drink doesn’t get him buzzed.

00:26:10.666 --> 00:26:11.958
Ask him to drink one more.

00:26:13.791 --> 00:26:15.458
I'll be needing another 60,000.

00:26:15.541 --> 00:26:16.666
Why so late?

00:26:16.791 --> 00:26:19.000
I got held up writing my record
at college.

00:26:19.166 --> 00:26:21.250
You were supposed
to get back home on time.

00:26:21.333 --> 00:26:24.000
You're the eldest in the household.
Whatever you do today,

00:26:24.083 --> 00:26:27.333
your five younger siblings
will take after you.

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:28.791
- Got it?
- Yeah.

00:26:29.541 --> 00:26:30.416
Be careful.

00:26:33.833 --> 00:26:36.500
Why bother her unnecessarily?
I'll apologize and be done with it.

00:27:09.416 --> 00:27:10.250
Wait.

00:27:10.333 --> 00:27:11.208
- Hey, Nithya!
- Brother!

00:27:11.291 --> 00:27:12.666
What's he doing here?

00:27:13.125 --> 00:27:16.125
Hey! Who do you think got us the tickets?
It's him.

00:27:16.458 --> 00:27:19.041
You asked for tickets for our group.
Now, he brought his group too.

00:27:19.166 --> 00:27:21.000
Look at them. They look so weird.

00:27:21.791 --> 00:27:23.916
They're all our friends, dear.

00:27:24.083 --> 00:27:25.458
They're not bad.

00:27:26.208 --> 00:27:27.250
Hello, brother.

00:27:28.041 --> 00:27:29.333
- Six for you, and six for us.
- Okay.

00:27:29.583 --> 00:27:31.208
It's time for the show. Let's go.

00:27:31.291 --> 00:27:34.250
Don't rush.
You'll have to push through the crowd.

00:27:34.416 --> 00:27:36.541
Let's wait and go in calmly.

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:40.541
Be careful if you step out
during the interval.

00:27:40.791 --> 00:27:42.000
Hey! My dad is here!

00:27:42.083 --> 00:27:43.416
- Where?
- Where is he?

00:27:44.166 --> 00:27:46.791
Here. He sounds just like my dad.

00:27:47.833 --> 00:27:50.208
Joke all you want, but be careful.

00:27:50.583 --> 00:27:52.083
What's with this nagging?

00:27:52.291 --> 00:27:54.708
You're talking
like you're an expert on girls.

00:27:54.916 --> 00:27:57.666
I don't know much about girls.
But I do know about guys.

00:27:57.875 --> 00:28:00.291
They're absolutely crazy.
So let's wait and get in.

00:28:01.583 --> 00:28:02.791
Dude, whistle!

00:28:07.625 --> 00:28:09.208
Nithya, sit here.

00:28:09.708 --> 00:28:10.708
Come here.

00:28:14.458 --> 00:28:15.458
Wow!

00:28:18.833 --> 00:28:20.541
YOUNG REBEL STAR
PRABHAS

00:28:21.166 --> 00:28:22.416
Our Prabhas!

00:28:22.875 --> 00:28:25.041
Let's love them, dude.
What's there to lose?

00:28:25.625 --> 00:28:27.000
They might even love us back.

00:29:07.041 --> 00:29:08.208
- Hello?
- Hello?

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.291
- Is that you who's talking?
- Why do you doubt that?

00:29:15.458 --> 00:29:17.541
I thought you'd start scolding me
the moment I answered.

00:29:17.625 --> 00:29:19.833
Seems like you’ll be upset
if I don’t scold you.

00:29:21.291 --> 00:29:23.125
Why did you call me the other day?

00:29:23.416 --> 00:29:26.083
Sorry. Sorry again.
That's twice like you asked.

00:29:26.458 --> 00:29:27.458
I’m sorry, too.

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:29.000
Why are you apologizing?

00:29:29.083 --> 00:29:31.208
You’re not as stupid as I thought.

00:29:31.458 --> 00:29:32.458
So, you mean…

00:29:32.625 --> 00:29:35.375
- Does that mean I’m a little stupid?
- Aren’t you?

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.250
Okay, then. I've got to go.

00:29:39.375 --> 00:29:40.375
Hello...

00:29:41.791 --> 00:29:43.083
What's your name?

00:29:43.625 --> 00:29:44.708
Jaabili.

00:29:46.125 --> 00:29:47.125
Jaabili…

00:29:59.583 --> 00:30:01.958
Hey, he's always on the phone these days!

00:30:02.041 --> 00:30:03.916
- Who’s he talking to?
- No idea.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.541
How could you not know?
You two are always together.

00:30:07.083 --> 00:30:08.791
Not just me, even he doesn’t know.

00:30:09.083 --> 00:30:12.125
How long are you going to
keep talking over the phone?

00:30:12.416 --> 00:30:13.666
Why don't you meet me?

00:30:13.958 --> 00:30:15.916
I will. When the time is right.

00:30:16.041 --> 00:30:17.541
- Don’t you have a boyfriend?
- No.

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:18.875
Why not?

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.416
What do you want me to say?

00:30:20.625 --> 00:30:22.750
- The heart must choose someone.
- The heart?

00:30:23.083 --> 00:30:24.208
Does that even exist?

00:30:24.291 --> 00:30:26.875
I’ve only heard about it in songs.
Never seen it for real.

00:30:26.958 --> 00:30:29.166
Tell me where to find it.
I’d like to take a look.

00:30:29.333 --> 00:30:30.250
Really?

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:32.333
What else?

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.916
- Start searching.
- Okay, sir.

00:30:55.375 --> 00:30:57.416
- What are you looking for, sir?
- What's this?

00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:58.500
Sir, it's marijuana!

00:30:58.583 --> 00:31:01.000
- Where did it come from?
- Are you smuggling marijuana in milk cans?

00:31:01.083 --> 00:31:02.875
I swear, I have no idea
where it came from.

00:31:02.958 --> 00:31:05.208
We don’t know anything about it, sir!

00:31:05.291 --> 00:31:06.291
Sir, please listen...

00:31:06.375 --> 00:31:08.791
Hey! If you have something to say,
come to the police station.

00:31:08.875 --> 00:31:11.583
- People here can vouch for us, sir!
- Let’s go.

00:31:12.083 --> 00:31:14.791
- Brother, I have no idea what’s going on!
- Dear…

00:31:14.875 --> 00:31:17.416
Don’t worry.
Let’s ask Mr. Mangapathi for help.

00:31:17.666 --> 00:31:18.500
Sir...

00:31:33.583 --> 00:31:34.666
Narayana.

00:31:35.125 --> 00:31:38.833
I spoke with them. It's a narcotics case.

00:31:39.583 --> 00:31:40.833
A pretty serious one.

00:31:42.375 --> 00:31:44.041
They say remand is unavoidable.

00:31:46.958 --> 00:31:49.875
He’ll be in jail… for 28 days.

00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:52.083
I’ll speak with my lawyer Damu.

00:31:52.291 --> 00:31:54.208
Why should I be in prison for 28 days?

00:31:55.083 --> 00:31:57.041
I haven’t done anything wrong, sir.

00:31:57.250 --> 00:31:58.458
I know that, Narayana.

00:31:58.625 --> 00:32:00.125
You didn’t do anything wrong.

00:32:00.416 --> 00:32:01.708
But your son did.

00:32:02.625 --> 00:32:04.333
What did my son do?

00:32:04.458 --> 00:32:06.125
He did something. Call him here..

00:32:06.333 --> 00:32:07.541
Hey! Come here!

00:32:09.708 --> 00:32:12.083
What were you doing
near the school this evening?

00:32:12.708 --> 00:32:14.000
Me? What did I do, sir?

00:32:14.416 --> 00:32:15.750
Outside the school gate…

00:32:16.291 --> 00:32:18.416
You gave my daughter a letter. Didn't you?

00:32:19.916 --> 00:32:20.916
What's going on?

00:32:21.333 --> 00:32:22.583
Hey, Keerthi.

00:32:22.875 --> 00:32:26.375
You forgot your worksheet in the class.
How will you write the exam tomorrow?

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:29.041
Oh no! I forgot. Thanks!

00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:31.250
Oh no! That wasn’t a letter!

00:32:32.125 --> 00:32:33.458
It was just a worksheet, sir.

00:32:33.875 --> 00:32:35.791
This is just a misunderstanding.

00:32:37.125 --> 00:32:42.166
You and my daughter are aware
that it’s just a worksheet.

00:32:42.333 --> 00:32:45.041
But any bystander
will assume it’s a love letter.

00:32:45.166 --> 00:32:47.250
He'll spread the news
in the entire village.

00:32:47.583 --> 00:32:49.333
"Milk vendor Narayana's son

00:32:50.083 --> 00:32:53.500
wrote a love letter
to Mr. Mangapathi’s daughter."

00:32:54.666 --> 00:32:55.875
That’s all it takes!

00:32:57.625 --> 00:32:59.291
And then the whole village will gossip.

00:32:59.375 --> 00:33:01.041
They shouldn’t talk about this.

00:33:01.125 --> 00:33:04.041
What did Mangapathi do
when he found out about the letter?

00:33:05.583 --> 00:33:07.208
That should be the discussion.

00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:09.958
Now, the whole village
will talk about this.

00:33:10.625 --> 00:33:13.041
Instead of discussing
whether you gave a letter,

00:33:13.541 --> 00:33:16.291
I’d rather they focus on
what Mangapathi did next.

00:33:16.916 --> 00:33:20.583
Hey! I can’t stop people from gossiping,

00:33:20.958 --> 00:33:24.083
but I can definitely change
the subject of their gossip.

00:33:24.375 --> 00:33:25.333
Got it?

00:33:25.875 --> 00:33:27.750
Now, this will be the new topic.

00:33:29.208 --> 00:33:30.375
Let them talk.

00:33:44.375 --> 00:33:46.000
You won’t meet me even if I ask,

00:33:46.083 --> 00:33:48.000
but at least share your Facebook ID.

00:33:48.083 --> 00:33:49.750
I’ll tell you when the time is right.

00:33:49.833 --> 00:33:51.541
- What are you doing?
- I’m eating upma.

00:33:51.708 --> 00:33:53.666
Yuck! Upma! I don’t like it at all.

00:33:53.791 --> 00:33:55.875
You don’t like it? Why not?

00:33:55.958 --> 00:33:57.958
How do you even know you don’t like it?

00:33:58.041 --> 00:33:59.208
What do you mean?

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:02.000
It’s a feeling.
You just don’t like some things.

00:34:02.708 --> 00:34:06.000
The thing inside you that determines
your feelings? That’s your heart.

00:34:06.083 --> 00:34:09.250
You can’t see it or hear it,
but it’s always calling the shots.

00:34:09.541 --> 00:34:11.416
You're quite smart, aren’t you?

00:34:12.708 --> 00:34:14.666
Why don’t you find a better job?

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:16.875
That’s the problem.

00:34:17.041 --> 00:34:19.333
A job would shackle my freedom

00:34:19.458 --> 00:34:21.083
and I refuse to live like that.

00:34:21.291 --> 00:34:24.750
How long will you keep doing
these part-time gigs as full-time work?

00:34:25.666 --> 00:34:27.208
Once I gain enough experience,

00:34:27.291 --> 00:34:29.125
I’ll start my own
event management company.

00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:30.250
That’s my goal.

00:34:30.833 --> 00:34:33.083
I’m saving up for that.

00:34:33.416 --> 00:34:34.791
Big ambitions.

00:34:37.833 --> 00:34:40.125
See? That’s how you talk to girls, dude.
Let’s go.

00:34:40.958 --> 00:34:42.916
Why is your name so different?

00:34:43.416 --> 00:34:44.375
Jaabili.

00:34:44.916 --> 00:34:46.333
Never heard it before.

00:34:46.666 --> 00:34:47.833
Who named you?

00:34:48.708 --> 00:34:49.666
My mother.

00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:53.000
She loves the moon and moonlight.

00:34:53.333 --> 00:34:56.083
So she named me Jaabili,
which means the same.

00:34:57.208 --> 00:34:58.666
Ma'am, are these the clothes?

00:34:58.875 --> 00:35:00.958
Yes, these are the ones.
Take them, Chandu.

00:35:06.125 --> 00:35:07.958
Hey, Jaabili! Did you go through

00:35:08.041 --> 00:35:09.833
- the skeleton muscle structure?
- Jaabili...

00:35:09.916 --> 00:35:11.291
- Did you understand it?
- Yes.

00:35:11.375 --> 00:35:12.916
I don't get it!

00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:46.875
Who called and stressed you out?

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.583
Customer care.

00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:55.625
Customer care?

00:36:20.375 --> 00:36:21.416
Yeah. Hello?

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:23.416
I’m calling from customer care.

00:36:23.583 --> 00:36:25.083
How can I help you?

00:36:25.291 --> 00:36:27.166
Will you stop that?

00:36:27.833 --> 00:36:31.166
- Is it the right time?
- Not really, but you’re forcing it anyway.

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:33.291
Whatever! I'm glad it finally happened.

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:35.916
- Will you meet me now?
- Yes, I will.

00:36:36.125 --> 00:36:39.083
- When the time is right.
- This again? How much longer?

00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:42.750
I will decide when is the right time
for us to meet.

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:47.416
Okay, wait. I’ll call once I reach home.

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:48.416
Okay.

00:37:00.791 --> 00:37:05.416
The mobile number you dialed
is currently switched off or unavailable.

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:08.625
The mobile you are trying to reach
is currently switched off...

00:37:16.041 --> 00:37:17.541
Oh! Group studies?

00:37:17.625 --> 00:37:19.833
No more group studies. Our exams are over!

00:37:19.916 --> 00:37:21.041
We’re just chilling!

00:37:21.125 --> 00:37:21.958
Oh!

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.750
The mobile is currently switched off
or unavailable.

00:37:33.958 --> 00:37:35.458
Why's Nithya calling?

00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:37.208
Hello?

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:41.958
Really? Where?

00:37:43.416 --> 00:37:44.291
I’ll be there.

00:37:46.708 --> 00:37:49.500
- Hey! Where are you going?
- I’ll be back soon.

00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:05.958
Yeah! You should face
whatever comes your way!

00:38:12.666 --> 00:38:14.666
Hey! Brother Chandu is here.

00:38:16.625 --> 00:38:17.583
Hi!

00:38:21.125 --> 00:38:22.791
Happy birthday, Nithya!

00:38:24.833 --> 00:38:26.125
Happy birthday!

00:38:31.625 --> 00:38:32.833
Is it done?

00:38:33.208 --> 00:38:34.333
Is that so?

00:38:47.083 --> 00:38:48.583
What’s wrong with your phone?

00:38:48.666 --> 00:38:50.916
It fell and broke,
so I sent it for repair.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.375
You’re acting like it’s no big deal?
Do you know how worried I was?

00:38:54.666 --> 00:38:56.041
What else did you feel?

00:39:00.166 --> 00:39:02.583
I don’t know how to explain it.

00:39:03.916 --> 00:39:05.250
It’s a different feeling.

00:39:05.375 --> 00:39:06.875
I’ve never felt it before.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.833
I don’t even know what to call it.

00:39:10.541 --> 00:39:14.000
If I feel the same, do you know
what that feeling is called?

00:39:17.916 --> 00:39:20.625
Uncle, can you get my phone repaired?

00:39:21.708 --> 00:39:22.583
Okay, dear.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.166
- Uncle, my phone…
- Sorry, I’ll get it tomorrow.

00:39:26.416 --> 00:39:28.041
Uncle, my phone?

00:39:28.125 --> 00:39:29.166
We’ll get it tomorrow.

00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:30.375
Hey, Jaabili!

00:39:30.666 --> 00:39:32.041
Nithya called you.

00:39:32.333 --> 00:39:35.041
Today is her birthday. Won’t you go?

00:39:35.541 --> 00:39:37.916
Didn’t you invite anyone else?

00:39:38.041 --> 00:39:40.375
Who else? These are our friends.

00:39:40.625 --> 00:39:43.083
I thought you’d invite
your brother Chandu.

00:39:43.166 --> 00:39:45.708
Oh! Thanks for reminding me.

00:39:45.916 --> 00:39:48.000
So you didn’t come here
because she called.

00:39:48.083 --> 00:39:50.500
I wanted you to be here,
so I made sure you came.

00:39:52.333 --> 00:39:55.041
Now tell me, what is this feeling called?

00:39:56.625 --> 00:39:58.416
If you had asked me four days ago,

00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:00.625
I'd have said, "Let the time come."

00:40:00.875 --> 00:40:03.500
But now, I feel like the time has come.

00:40:03.958 --> 00:40:04.791
Tell me.

Idiot! It means,
I already feel like we're married.

00:43:27.541 --> 00:43:29.125
- Fool!

00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:32.083
I'm not attending

00:43:32.166 --> 00:43:34.250
- Why?
- I'm attending my cousin's wedding.

00:43:34.875 --> 00:43:35.833
All right, go.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.875

Excuse me, sir.

Sir, I told you about
a case in Vizag the other day.

00:45:15.875 --> 00:45:17.791
They’re here. Here is their case file.

00:45:20.458 --> 00:45:22.708
I'll go through it.
Ask them to come tomorrow evening.

00:45:22.916 --> 00:45:25.458
But Monday is the final judgment.

00:45:36.208 --> 00:45:38.000
- POCSO?
- Yes, sir.

00:45:38.416 --> 00:45:41.750
If we take this case, do we have to be
in Vizag court on Monday?

00:45:41.916 --> 00:45:42.750
Yes, sir.

00:45:44.083 --> 00:45:45.958
Okay. Ask them to come tomorrow evening.

00:45:46.125 --> 00:45:47.416
- Okay, sir.
- By the by,

00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:50.833
does this file have
the depositions and cross-examinations?

00:45:50.916 --> 00:45:51.875
Yes, sir.

00:45:52.708 --> 00:45:55.250
Send the people
related to the Nuzvid case.

00:45:55.333 --> 00:45:56.208
Okay, sir.

00:45:58.208 --> 00:45:59.750
- Please go in.
- Okay, sir.

00:46:01.625 --> 00:46:04.583
He will talk to you tomorrow.
Come in the evening.

00:46:04.916 --> 00:46:06.875
We’ll wait, no matter how late it gets.

00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:08.750
I understand your pain.

00:46:09.333 --> 00:46:10.583
It’s not about waiting.

00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:14.000
He will review the file first,
then he’ll talk with you.

00:46:15.041 --> 00:46:16.583
It's okay. Come back tomorrow.

00:46:20.666 --> 00:46:21.666
Let’s go.

00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:30.250
Mr. Mohan Rao went out.

00:46:30.333 --> 00:46:31.916
He'll be back. Please sit.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.541
- I’ll call him.
- Okay, sir.

00:46:39.333 --> 00:46:42.000
He isn’t answering. Please wait.
He’ll be back soon.

00:46:51.166 --> 00:46:54.458
Make a copy of Jitu vs. Union of India.
I’ll be right back.

00:46:54.541 --> 00:46:57.000
- Sir, can you call him again?
- I’ll call you back.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.791
He'll get mad if I keep calling.

00:47:01.125 --> 00:47:02.791
I’ll let you know when he calls.

00:47:04.291 --> 00:47:05.875
I understand you’re stressed.

00:47:07.125 --> 00:47:10.625
I’ve gone through your case file.
Forget what’s already in there.

00:47:11.041 --> 00:47:13.125
Tell me your side of the story.

00:47:16.208 --> 00:47:19.333
Oh dear! Time is flying!
She must be waiting. I need to go.

00:47:19.458 --> 00:47:21.833
Hey! If Reddanna comes here,
tell him I went home.

00:47:21.958 --> 00:47:23.166
Take care of it here.

00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:25.916
What, dude? That girl’s been visiting
your house every day.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.208
What if there's no one at home?

00:47:28.333 --> 00:47:30.083
What are you trying to say?

00:47:30.291 --> 00:47:32.916
Suppose your mom and sister
are not at home

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.000
then you'll be alone with that girl
in your house.

00:47:36.083 --> 00:47:37.250
What would happen then?

00:47:40.041 --> 00:47:41.583
I see where you're going.

00:47:41.666 --> 00:47:44.333
Don’t overthink.
Nothing cinematic is happening.

00:47:44.583 --> 00:47:46.666
I’ve seen plenty of films just like this.

00:47:47.041 --> 00:47:49.250
- Just drop me home.
- Come on.

00:47:57.333 --> 00:48:01.666
Dude, stop at the pharmacy.
Need to pick up some meds for my grandma.

00:48:05.416 --> 00:48:07.958
- Jaabili is calling. Hurry up.
- Coming, dude.

00:48:09.166 --> 00:48:10.333
- Hello?
- Hello?

00:48:10.416 --> 00:48:12.250
Where are you? I've already reached.

00:48:12.458 --> 00:48:14.541
I'm almost there. I'll get there soon.

00:48:14.958 --> 00:48:16.208
- Hurry up.
- Okay.

00:48:17.583 --> 00:48:18.750
Come fast.

00:48:27.833 --> 00:48:29.875
- What are you doing, Mom?
- Can’t you see?

00:48:30.291 --> 00:48:31.625
I’m just playing around.

00:48:32.666 --> 00:48:35.333
- Where are you coming from?
- From the internet cafe.

00:48:35.416 --> 00:48:38.000
Always lingering around that place!
Won't you do anything worthwhile?

00:48:38.083 --> 00:48:40.166
Brother, Dad will be here soon.

00:49:20.291 --> 00:49:21.666
Ask the girl to step out.

00:49:22.083 --> 00:49:23.000
Which girl, sir?

00:49:23.083 --> 00:49:25.500
There’s no one here.
I think you’ve got the wrong address.

00:49:25.583 --> 00:49:27.000
Quiet! You don’t know anything.

00:49:27.083 --> 00:49:28.208
They know everything.

00:49:29.666 --> 00:49:30.833
I said, bring her out!

00:49:32.708 --> 00:49:34.375
Will you call her,
or should I drag her out?

00:49:44.375 --> 00:49:45.375
Which girl?

00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:51.708
Who's the girl?

00:49:51.916 --> 00:49:53.791
Jaabili! What’s going on?

00:49:53.916 --> 00:49:54.791
Why are you here?

00:49:54.875 --> 00:49:56.083
- Who are they?
- Who is this girl?

00:49:56.166 --> 00:49:58.208
You said you were going to class.
Why are you here?

00:49:58.291 --> 00:49:59.333
Who’s that girl?

00:49:59.416 --> 00:50:01.083
What are you doing in their house?

00:50:01.166 --> 00:50:03.125
- Aunty! Aunty!
- Hey!

00:50:03.416 --> 00:50:05.500
- Whom are you calling aunty?
- Stop it.

00:50:05.583 --> 00:50:07.166
Don't lay a hand on him.
Show some respect!

00:50:07.250 --> 00:50:08.250
Get lost!

00:50:09.583 --> 00:50:13.000
Your son is behaving disgracefully,
and you’re talking about respect?

00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:14.583
Hey!

00:50:14.666 --> 00:50:16.666
How dare you talk back!

00:50:16.791 --> 00:50:18.750
- Take him.
- Sir, what’s happening?

00:50:18.916 --> 00:50:21.375
The girl is 17 years and 8 months old.

00:50:21.791 --> 00:50:25.416
She’s a minor. Taking her anywhere
without her parents' consent is a crime.

00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:27.500
- So, we’re arresting your son.
- Arrest?

00:50:27.583 --> 00:50:29.333
If you have anything to say,
come to the station.

00:50:29.416 --> 00:50:30.583
- Sir!
- Sir!

00:50:30.708 --> 00:50:31.583
Sir, let me go.

00:50:32.166 --> 00:50:36.125
I can put your whole family behind bars
for aiding a minor’s kidnapping.

00:50:36.750 --> 00:50:38.208
But we’re only taking him.

00:50:38.375 --> 00:50:40.208
- Sir, please listen.
- Get him in the jeep.

00:50:40.291 --> 00:50:42.250
That’s our mercy.

00:50:42.333 --> 00:50:43.166
- Come on.
- Sir!

00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:45.500
He didn't do it intentionally.
Please let him go.

00:50:45.625 --> 00:50:46.708
Mom!

00:50:47.333 --> 00:50:49.041
Please help us, ma'am!

00:50:49.125 --> 00:50:50.416
- I beg you.
- Mom!

00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:53.291
- Sir!
- Please let him go just this once.

00:50:53.375 --> 00:50:55.125
- Sir, please let him go.
- Mom!

00:50:55.208 --> 00:50:57.666
Please forgive him, sir!

00:51:01.041 --> 00:51:03.541
- What happened, dear?
- I don't know, Mom.

00:51:04.083 --> 00:51:06.583
- Chandu!
- Mom!

00:51:07.291 --> 00:51:08.291
Mom!

00:51:08.458 --> 00:51:09.583
Mom!

00:51:52.583 --> 00:51:54.333
What are you doing? Please, stop.

00:51:54.458 --> 00:51:55.500
Hey!

00:51:59.250 --> 00:52:01.625
You think our family's reputation
is a joke?

00:52:01.708 --> 00:52:04.208
How dare you ruin our family's reputation?

00:52:04.291 --> 00:52:07.166
We sent you to study.
But you're roaming around with some guy!

00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:10.250
What about our honor!
Who will marry a girl from this household?

00:52:14.208 --> 00:52:16.708
- Reddy.
- The boy’s family is here.

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.916
I stopped them outside.
What do we do with the boy?

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.041
What else? File a case against him!

00:52:23.083 --> 00:52:24.166
Okay, I’ll do that.

00:52:24.375 --> 00:52:26.500
What charges should we file?
What’s your complaint?

00:52:26.583 --> 00:52:29.500
What’s the girl’s statement?
I need all these details.

00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:31.250
Once I talk to the girl,

00:52:31.416 --> 00:52:33.666
then we’ll decide what to do.

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:35.041
I’ll bring her.

00:52:35.708 --> 00:52:36.916
Come. Get in the vehicle.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.000
- Where are we going?
- The police station.

00:52:39.083 --> 00:52:39.958
Why?

00:52:40.041 --> 00:52:42.208
The police need her statement
to file a case against him.

00:52:42.291 --> 00:52:43.291
A case?

00:52:43.541 --> 00:52:46.041
So, my daughter has to keep running
to the court and the police station?

00:52:46.125 --> 00:52:48.125
Yes. Otherwise, how will we get justice?

00:52:49.041 --> 00:52:50.291
That won’t be necessary.

00:52:50.541 --> 00:52:52.333
Just warn the boy and let him go.

00:52:52.916 --> 00:52:54.750
What did you say? Let him go?

00:52:55.208 --> 00:52:57.083
Why should I let him go?

00:52:57.500 --> 00:52:59.750
Do you understand
what you saw with your own eyes?

00:52:59.916 --> 00:53:02.250
He took her into his room!

00:53:04.625 --> 00:53:05.958
Do you get it now?

00:53:06.958 --> 00:53:08.166
Who the hell is he?

00:53:08.708 --> 00:53:10.916
The son of a mere watchman.

00:53:12.375 --> 00:53:13.750
And you want me to spare him?

00:53:13.833 --> 00:53:16.125
If I do that, more boys
will be at our doorstep tomorrow,

00:53:16.208 --> 00:53:18.208
asking to take our daughters out.

00:53:18.750 --> 00:53:19.750
Should I send them too?

00:53:20.041 --> 00:53:21.416
Do whatever you want.

00:53:22.041 --> 00:53:24.750
But I won’t send my daughter
to police stations and court.

00:53:24.833 --> 00:53:28.541
If necessary, I’ll even pull her out
of school and keep her home.

00:53:32.666 --> 00:53:36.250
The girl makes a mistake,
and the mother supports her.

00:53:41.875 --> 00:53:43.291
What do you say, Father-in-law?

00:53:43.375 --> 00:53:45.666
What are you staring at?
What should we do?

00:53:47.708 --> 00:53:49.000
Why are you silent?

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:51.208
- That…
- What?

00:53:52.083 --> 00:53:54.916
Please make sure this doesn't get out,
Son-in-law.

00:54:01.041 --> 00:54:02.333
Something must be done.

00:54:03.125 --> 00:54:04.458
It can’t get out.

00:54:05.625 --> 00:54:07.083
We’ll handle it.

00:54:10.625 --> 00:54:11.541
Hey, Damu.

00:54:11.791 --> 00:54:14.208
Where are you?
We need to go to the police station.

00:54:54.958 --> 00:54:56.583
Give them the file I gave you.

00:54:57.916 --> 00:54:59.083
Give me a paper.

00:55:24.916 --> 00:55:26.958
This is the complaint. File an FIR.

00:55:27.833 --> 00:55:29.208
Note down the law sections.

00:55:29.458 --> 00:55:31.208
Section 366A,

00:55:31.916 --> 00:55:33.916
procuration of a minor girl.

00:55:34.041 --> 00:55:35.416
Section 354A,

00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:37.375
sexual harassment of a girl.

00:55:37.625 --> 00:55:38.750
Section 354B,

00:55:39.166 --> 00:55:41.000
criminal force against a girl.

00:55:41.416 --> 00:55:42.666
Section 354C,

00:55:42.833 --> 00:55:45.250
voyeurism and blackmailing a girl.

00:55:45.375 --> 00:55:46.416
Section 354D,

00:55:46.958 --> 00:55:48.291
stalking a girl.

00:55:48.833 --> 00:55:49.750
And

00:55:50.083 --> 00:55:52.166
sections 11 and 12 of…

00:55:52.625 --> 00:55:53.958
POCSO Act.

00:55:55.458 --> 00:55:56.541
POCSO Act?

00:55:56.875 --> 00:55:57.916
POCSO?

00:55:58.583 --> 00:56:00.666
But the girl was with his family.

00:56:00.875 --> 00:56:03.166
Does POCSO even apply in this case?

00:56:11.708 --> 00:56:14.625
Putting an arm on someone's shoulder
is just friendship.

00:56:14.708 --> 00:56:18.250
If an adult boy over eighteen
takes his hand and puts it on a girl

00:56:18.333 --> 00:56:21.500
who is not yet eighteen,
it falls under POCSO Act.

00:56:22.041 --> 00:56:24.416
Even if the girl comes to court tomorrow

00:56:24.958 --> 00:56:28.541
and declares it was not the boy's fault
and she placed his hand there herself

00:56:28.625 --> 00:56:30.416
he’ll still be punished.
That’s POCSO.

00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:32.166
He's 19 years old. File the case.

00:56:32.250 --> 00:56:34.875
I will tell you about the witnesses
and evidence later.

00:56:34.958 --> 00:56:36.875
Once you go through the complaint,

00:56:36.958 --> 00:56:39.583
I’ll get it signed by the girl's mother.
Meanwhile...

00:56:40.541 --> 00:56:43.791
Make sure he agrees
to whatever is written in the complaint.

00:56:43.875 --> 00:56:45.833
Use your… methods.

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:48.625
If he confesses,
you won't even need me in court.

00:56:49.458 --> 00:56:50.541
One more thing.

00:56:51.041 --> 00:56:52.750
The girl won’t be coming to court.

00:56:52.833 --> 00:56:54.875
Keep that in mind while handling this.

00:56:55.958 --> 00:56:57.958
How will this work if she doesn’t testify?

00:56:58.041 --> 00:57:00.583
We can take the case forward
under the POCSO Act.

00:57:00.666 --> 00:57:02.708
But the judge won’t pass a verdict
without speaking to her.

00:57:02.791 --> 00:57:03.833
I’ll handle that, OK?

00:57:04.875 --> 00:57:05.958
I’ll take care of it.

00:57:06.291 --> 00:57:07.416
Just do as I said.

00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:11.708
Let’s go.

00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:18.041
What’s this, sir? Who is he?

00:57:18.125 --> 00:57:20.583
He used to be a junior lawyer
with Mangapathi’s father.

00:57:20.875 --> 00:57:22.833
Now, he’s a senior lawyer
in the district court.

00:57:23.166 --> 00:57:26.041
Even so, how can he dictate
what we should do?

00:57:26.208 --> 00:57:28.500
If he doesn’t, Mangapathi will.
You okay with that?

00:57:32.666 --> 00:57:34.875
Have you ever seen Damu argue in court?

00:57:34.958 --> 00:57:35.833
No.

00:57:36.750 --> 00:57:38.625
That’s why you’re talking like this.

00:57:39.041 --> 00:57:41.166
Once you see him in action,
you’ll understand.

00:57:56.625 --> 00:57:59.250
I’ve been watching you all.
You seem really stressed.

00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:01.125
There’s nothing to worry about.

00:58:01.208 --> 00:58:02.833
They’ll keep him here overnight.

00:58:02.958 --> 00:58:05.375
They’ll have him sign an agreement
promising not to repeat this

00:58:05.458 --> 00:58:06.458
and release him.

00:58:06.541 --> 00:58:07.541
Don't worry.

00:58:07.875 --> 00:58:10.375
Why are so many people here?
Just one or two can stay.

00:58:10.458 --> 00:58:12.541
- The rest can leave.
- Okay, sir.

00:58:20.458 --> 00:58:22.666
Will you accept the charges
against you, or not?

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.250
- Hey! Turn around!
- Sir!

00:58:36.708 --> 00:58:38.000
Please drink it, Aunty.

00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:41.166
- You haven’t eaten since the afternoon.
- No, dear.

00:58:41.791 --> 00:58:43.666
- Drink it.
- They said they’d let him go.

00:58:43.875 --> 00:58:46.416
- Please drink.
- You need your strength.

00:58:55.583 --> 00:58:56.791
Sir, please don’t hit me!

00:58:57.583 --> 00:59:00.208
- Sir! Please don't hit me.
- Will you accept?

00:59:00.333 --> 00:59:01.625
- Sir!
- Hold him properly.

00:59:05.666 --> 00:59:07.666
Will you accept the charges, or not?

00:59:10.125 --> 00:59:11.333
Sir!

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:13.916
Mom!

00:59:16.375 --> 00:59:18.500
Here’s the complaint. Please sign it.

00:59:19.083 --> 00:59:21.166
Your daughter won’t need to come to court

00:59:21.250 --> 00:59:23.833
but you’ll have to come
and explain why she can't.

00:59:24.250 --> 00:59:26.291
I’ll explain what you need to say later.

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.708
Son-in-law, please think this through.

00:59:44.166 --> 00:59:46.208
You once delivered judgments
as the village elder,

00:59:46.291 --> 00:59:48.125
and now you speak like a guilty man.

00:59:48.875 --> 00:59:50.875
See how far you’ve fallen!

00:59:53.375 --> 00:59:55.375
And now you’re telling me to reconsider?

00:59:56.041 --> 00:59:57.208
Shame on you!

00:59:58.083 --> 00:59:59.791
If you let me do my job,

01:00:00.291 --> 01:00:01.833
you'll have your respect.

01:00:02.958 --> 01:00:04.000
Just sign it!

01:00:22.166 --> 01:00:23.250
What’s this?

01:00:23.458 --> 01:00:24.833
Why is he limping?

01:00:26.250 --> 01:00:28.208
Chandu! What happened?

01:00:29.291 --> 01:00:31.041
- Mom!
- What happened to your leg, dear?

01:00:31.125 --> 01:00:33.541
- Where are you taking him?
- What happened, sir?

01:00:33.875 --> 01:00:35.083
Please let him go, sir.

01:00:35.166 --> 01:00:37.000
Please let me speak to them.

01:00:37.083 --> 01:00:39.583
- Mom!
- Hey, move!

01:00:39.916 --> 01:00:42.416
- Get him into the vehicle!
- Chandu!

01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:44.166
- Wait a minute, sir!
- Chandu!

01:00:44.250 --> 01:00:45.875
- Bro!
- Chandu!

01:00:46.916 --> 01:00:48.166
What’s your education level?

01:00:48.583 --> 01:00:49.583
12th grade, ma'am.

01:00:49.708 --> 01:00:50.958
What’s your percentage?

01:00:52.416 --> 01:00:53.708
I flunked the exam, ma’am.

01:00:57.125 --> 01:00:59.166
Fourteen days judicial remand.

01:01:00.458 --> 01:01:01.416
Yeah.

01:01:07.125 --> 01:01:08.166
Greetings, sir.

01:01:09.708 --> 01:01:11.750
Remove your belt and wallet.

01:01:12.041 --> 01:01:13.416
Hey! What’s in your pocket?

01:01:14.250 --> 01:01:16.416
- A wallet? Take it out.
- Sir…

01:01:17.125 --> 01:01:18.541
Give it here. What’s this?

01:01:18.666 --> 01:01:19.916
Take off your belt.

01:01:25.416 --> 01:01:27.750
- Come. Take him inside.
- Sir!

01:01:29.291 --> 01:01:30.541
One minute, sir.

01:01:30.833 --> 01:01:31.750
Sir.

01:01:31.958 --> 01:01:32.875
What is it?

01:01:38.041 --> 01:01:39.000
- Move.
- Come on!

01:01:39.125 --> 01:01:40.250
- Sir!
- Take him inside.

01:01:40.375 --> 01:01:41.291
Sir...

01:01:41.583 --> 01:01:42.750
The SI is here.

01:01:47.083 --> 01:01:48.958
A case has been filed against your boy.

01:01:49.041 --> 01:01:51.500
He’s in judicial custody for 14 days.
We’ve sent him to sub-jail.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.916
If you have anything to say,
bring your lawyer and say it in court.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.833
My men will inform you
about the next hearing.

01:01:58.916 --> 01:02:00.791
- Here’s a copy of the FIR.
- Sir!

01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:05.291
What’s the case? Why is it going to court?

01:02:05.375 --> 01:02:06.916
They said they’d let him go.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.083
I don't understand
what's going on here.

01:02:18.541 --> 01:02:19.416
Hello, sir.

01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:22.458
- Mr. Ramakrishna sent us.
- Yes, he told me. Take a seat.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:28.875
Woah!

01:02:29.625 --> 01:02:30.666
What's this?

01:02:31.250 --> 01:02:34.125
Are they seeking justice or revenge?
What are these sections?

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.083
This is a tough case.

01:02:36.291 --> 01:02:37.625
- Sir!
- It's all right.

01:02:38.208 --> 01:02:41.250
We'll deal with this in court.
It’s my job to get your friend released.

01:02:41.375 --> 01:02:42.541
Let's apply for bail, first.

01:02:42.625 --> 01:02:45.000
The fee would be around 50,000 rupees.
Is that okay?

01:02:46.625 --> 01:02:47.708
We're fine with it.

01:02:47.958 --> 01:02:50.208
- Go ahead.
- Mr. Siva Ram.

01:02:50.875 --> 01:02:53.333
I’m glad you’ve taken up this case.

01:02:53.666 --> 01:02:56.166
I want you to argue this case
until the final judgment.

01:02:56.250 --> 01:02:57.250
But…

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.416
I must win.

01:03:05.958 --> 01:03:09.333
Let’s come to an understanding
and deal with this case properly.

01:03:11.916 --> 01:03:13.083
POCSO session!

01:03:13.250 --> 01:03:15.541
Case no. 16/2013.

01:03:15.708 --> 01:03:18.541
State represented by
Bheemunipatnam Police Station

01:03:18.625 --> 01:03:21.625
vs. Mettu Chandrasekhar, alias Chandu.

01:03:23.458 --> 01:03:26.750
K.S. Damodar, prosecutor on behalf
of the complainant, Your Honor.

01:03:27.583 --> 01:03:29.666
D. Siva Ram,
advocate for the accused, Your Honor.

01:03:30.833 --> 01:03:31.791
Read the complaint.

01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:36.500
"To the respected CI
of Bheemunipatnam police station,

01:03:36.666 --> 01:03:38.666
"Sir,
here’s a brief for your consideration.

01:03:38.916 --> 01:03:40.458
"My name is Meruvalli Seetha Ratnam.

01:03:40.541 --> 01:03:42.666
"I live in Tagarapuvalasa
in Bheemunipatnam Mandal

01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:44.583
"in Vishakhapatnam District.

01:03:44.833 --> 01:03:46.458
"My daughter Meruvalli Jaabili

01:03:46.541 --> 01:03:49.083
"has completed 12th grade
and travels daily by bus

01:03:49.166 --> 01:03:52.208
"to an institute in Vishakhapatnam
for EAMCET coaching.

01:03:52.458 --> 01:03:55.541
"Today, i.e., on 9th March 2013,

01:03:55.625 --> 01:03:57.375
"at around 12:30 p.m.

01:03:57.458 --> 01:04:00.625
"while she was waiting for the bus
near the Dwaraka Bus Station

01:04:00.708 --> 01:04:02.458
"in Vishakhapatnam RTC complex,

01:04:02.541 --> 01:04:05.541
"a guy on a motorbike approached her,
threatened her,

01:04:05.625 --> 01:04:09.083
"forced her onto the motorbike,
and took her away.

01:04:09.458 --> 01:04:11.500
"Devudu Babu, a resident of our village,

01:04:11.583 --> 01:04:14.291
"witnessed the incident
and called us immediately.

01:04:14.375 --> 01:04:18.166
"He also noted down the motorbike number,
which is AP 31 DL 7347.

01:04:18.250 --> 01:04:20.083
"Please accept my complaint,

01:04:20.291 --> 01:04:23.333
"and take appropriate action
to save my daughter.

01:04:23.541 --> 01:04:25.291
Yours sincerely, M. Seetha Ratnam."

01:04:28.333 --> 01:04:29.916
- Prosecution.
- Yes, Your Honor.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.208
Acting on the complaint,
the police arrested the accused.

01:04:34.666 --> 01:04:37.666
And through the victim Jaabili
and her friends, it was found

01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:40.791
that this guy had been after this girl
for quite some time,

01:04:41.041 --> 01:04:44.125
and was coercing her
to have a physical relationship with him.

01:04:44.541 --> 01:04:47.916
He was blackmailing her
that he'd upload her morphed photos online

01:04:48.041 --> 01:04:50.416
if she didn't comply, Your Honor.

01:04:51.833 --> 01:04:54.041
Police are investigating this aspect.

01:04:54.208 --> 01:04:56.583
They need some time
to file a charge sheet.

01:04:57.500 --> 01:04:58.333
Defense.

01:04:58.416 --> 01:05:00.250
The bail application is submitted,
Your Honor.

01:05:03.041 --> 01:05:03.958
Your Honor!

01:05:04.041 --> 01:05:06.750
I want to make one point
very clear to this Honorable Court.

01:05:06.833 --> 01:05:09.791
This case has to be dealt
with the utmost sensitivity.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.916
As we all know, the victim is a minor.

01:05:13.625 --> 01:05:17.208
The accused is blackmailing
a minor girl, Your Honor!

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:20.291
In this situation,
if bail is granted and he’s released,

01:05:20.375 --> 01:05:22.833
there is every possibility of him
making irreversible mistakes,

01:05:22.916 --> 01:05:24.708
which can never, ever be undone!

01:05:25.041 --> 01:05:28.041
Granting him bail
is risking the minor girl's dignity,

01:05:28.125 --> 01:05:31.791
credibility, integrity, modesty
and self-respect, Your Honor.

01:05:32.958 --> 01:05:34.708
Someone who is roaming freely

01:05:34.791 --> 01:05:37.875
cannot be restricted from using
the internet, Your Honor.

01:05:38.083 --> 01:05:40.708
If he’s released on bail,
and uses the internet,

01:05:40.791 --> 01:05:43.416
and does something else
to harm the girl…

01:05:46.416 --> 01:05:49.291
Nobody in this court can do her justice!

01:05:49.375 --> 01:05:54.583
That must be taken into account
when deciding whether to grant bail.

01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:56.583
That’s all, Your Honor!

01:06:01.541 --> 01:06:02.791
Bail rejected!

01:06:05.541 --> 01:06:06.750
Thank you, Your Honor!

01:06:20.375 --> 01:06:22.000
Sir! Sir!

01:06:22.750 --> 01:06:24.708
Whatever they said inside
the court is all lies.

01:06:24.791 --> 01:06:26.208
Even the judge knows that.

01:06:26.291 --> 01:06:28.916
My job is to prove it wrong. I will.

01:06:29.125 --> 01:06:31.500
Come to my office in the evening
and pay me.

01:06:37.583 --> 01:06:38.541
Your Honor.

01:06:38.833 --> 01:06:40.000
On May 9th,

01:06:40.416 --> 01:06:43.625
before taking the victim, Jaabili,
from the bus stop forcefully,

01:06:43.708 --> 01:06:46.708
the accused, Chandu, stopped
at a chemist's shop.

01:06:46.791 --> 01:06:50.375
LW4, Mr. Chinna Rao, will tell us
what happened over there, Your Honor.

01:06:51.083 --> 01:06:52.625
Tell us, Mr. Chinna Rao.

01:06:52.750 --> 01:06:55.250
What happened at your shop on May 9th?

01:06:58.416 --> 01:07:00.333
- Come fast, Jaabili’s call.
- Coming, dude.

01:07:01.083 --> 01:07:03.166
Brother, give me a packet.

01:07:04.833 --> 01:07:06.625
It isn't for me. It’s for my friend.

01:07:10.333 --> 01:07:11.333
All right.

01:07:15.916 --> 01:07:18.250
The guy said he bought it
for his friend, sir.

01:07:18.333 --> 01:07:20.291
No, no, no. Be clear, Mr. Chinna Rao.

01:07:20.416 --> 01:07:21.958
What did he buy? Please specify.

01:07:23.541 --> 01:07:24.666
- Condoms, sir!
- What?

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:27.458
I didn’t catch that. Say it louder.

01:07:27.791 --> 01:07:30.000
- Condoms, sir.
- Condoms! Condoms!

01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:32.291
The accused bought condoms, Your Honor.

01:07:32.416 --> 01:07:35.333
Why? Does a condom serve
any other purpose than for sex?

01:07:35.875 --> 01:07:38.541
No! That means, it’s clearly evident

01:07:38.625 --> 01:07:41.708
that the accused had the intention
to exploit the girl sexually.

01:07:42.541 --> 01:07:43.708
That’s all, Your Honor.

01:07:44.750 --> 01:07:46.541
Any defense questions for the witness?

01:07:46.708 --> 01:07:48.166
Please consider the bail application,
Your Honor.

01:07:48.250 --> 01:07:49.083
Your Honor.

01:07:50.166 --> 01:07:55.166
It’s a minor girl’s integrity, modesty,
credibility, and self-respect, Your Honor.

01:07:57.291 --> 01:07:58.208
Bail rejected.

01:08:00.750 --> 01:08:02.875
Sir, why hasn’t bail been granted yet?

01:08:02.958 --> 01:08:05.000
How can he get bail
when he bought a condom?

01:08:06.708 --> 01:08:08.666
Your Honor!
On that day at the bus station,

01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:13.916
this guy's disgusting behavior
was witnessed by LW 5, 6, and 7.

01:08:14.125 --> 01:08:16.416
{\an8}I request the Court to present witnesses

01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:19.166
{\an8}Devudu Babu, Ramu Naidu,
and Appala Swamy.

01:08:19.250 --> 01:08:20.166
TRUTH ALONE TRIUMPHS

01:08:20.250 --> 01:08:21.583
What happened on that day?

01:08:22.583 --> 01:08:25.458
That day, after visiting
the Simhachalam Appanna Swamy temple,

01:08:25.541 --> 01:08:27.458
the three of us were waiting
at the bus station

01:08:27.541 --> 01:08:28.916
to catch a bus to our village.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.583
Meanwhile, this guy approached a girl,
threatened her

01:08:31.666 --> 01:08:33.375
and tried to force himself on her.

01:08:33.458 --> 01:08:37.291
I looked at the girl and realized
she is Mr. Muthyalaiah’s granddaughter.

01:08:37.625 --> 01:08:39.666
Before I could get closer
to see what was happening,

01:08:39.791 --> 01:08:42.416
he grabbed her by the hand
and took off on his motorbike.

01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:45.625
I noted down the bike number,
and informed Mr. Muthyalaiah about it.

01:08:50.208 --> 01:08:52.333
Any defense cross-examination
to the witnesses?

01:08:52.416 --> 01:08:53.291
Yes, Your Honor.

01:08:58.750 --> 01:09:01.708
Mr. Devudu Babu,
on the day of the incident,

01:09:02.583 --> 01:09:05.041
can you recall the color of the shirt
the guy was wearing?

01:09:05.416 --> 01:09:06.708
Yellow T-shirt, sir.

01:09:08.083 --> 01:09:10.166
- What about the girl’s dress?
- Pink, sir.

01:09:11.166 --> 01:09:13.416
Mr. Appala Swamy, can you tell us
the color of his bike?

01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:14.625
Black, sir.

01:09:14.875 --> 01:09:16.541
No further questions, Your Honor.

01:09:17.708 --> 01:09:19.291
Please consider the bail petition.

01:09:24.208 --> 01:09:25.333
Bail rejected.

01:09:27.833 --> 01:09:30.083
On May 9th, were you aware

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:33.458
that there was a girl inside
the room in your house?

01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:35.500
No.

01:09:36.958 --> 01:09:38.000
Hey, hey!

01:09:38.833 --> 01:09:40.583
I'm receiving two different answers.

01:09:42.166 --> 01:09:43.666
Be specific. Answer one by one.

01:09:43.750 --> 01:09:46.083
You first. Did you know
the girl was there?

01:09:48.166 --> 01:09:49.416
I knew, sir.

01:09:51.541 --> 01:09:54.083
Now, you tell me. Did you know?

01:09:54.541 --> 01:09:55.875
- I didn’t know, sir.
- Wow!

01:09:56.041 --> 01:09:58.166
Wow! Wonderful! Superb!

01:09:59.375 --> 01:10:02.541
Mom knew the girl was there,
and Dad didn’t.

01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:04.458
Excellent! Superb!

01:10:05.166 --> 01:10:06.083
Oh heck!

01:10:06.666 --> 01:10:09.208
This is a shameful example
of Indian parenting, Your Honor.

01:10:12.416 --> 01:10:16.083
I don’t even feel like asking you
another question. Please leave.

01:10:17.083 --> 01:10:18.208
That’s all, Your Honor.

01:10:21.125 --> 01:10:22.166
Bail rejected.

01:10:55.666 --> 01:10:57.416
Mom, did you iron my shirt?

01:11:03.208 --> 01:11:05.958
Mrs. Seetha Ratnam,
after lodging the complaint,

01:11:06.041 --> 01:11:08.250
when you went to the boy’s house
with the police,

01:11:08.333 --> 01:11:10.750
did you see your daughter
coming out of the room?

01:11:15.875 --> 01:11:16.875
I did.

01:11:19.833 --> 01:11:23.000
I'm sorry for what happened
to your daughter.

01:11:23.291 --> 01:11:27.583
In this situation, I deeply regret
having to call you to the stand.

01:11:27.958 --> 01:11:29.000
Please be brave.

01:11:29.791 --> 01:11:33.291
The court will serve justice
to your daughter. Have faith!

01:11:35.250 --> 01:11:36.250
Your Honor!

01:11:36.958 --> 01:11:41.291
So far, we’ve gathered case-related
information from the witnesses.

01:11:41.583 --> 01:11:45.125
However, all that should be
confirmed by the victim, Jaabili.

01:11:45.375 --> 01:11:48.750
But unfortunately, she is not
in a condition to make any statements.

01:11:51.541 --> 01:11:55.791
Due to her abnormal behavior,
she was taken to a psychiatrist

01:11:55.916 --> 01:11:59.208
the very next day after the incident,
Your Honor.

01:12:00.458 --> 01:12:01.958
Dr. Prabhakar,

01:12:02.166 --> 01:12:05.125
can you explain the complications
in Jaabili’s mental health?

01:12:05.375 --> 01:12:09.416
Well, she has suffered
severe mental trauma due to blackmail.

01:12:09.541 --> 01:12:12.416
This is a very common case
of bipolar disorder.

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:16.083
She is undergoing treatment.
It’ll take some time for recovery.

01:12:16.166 --> 01:12:18.416
Okay, but, can she
at least give a statement?

01:12:18.541 --> 01:12:20.083
No. She can’t.

01:12:20.416 --> 01:12:22.166
- I know it’s--
- Actually,

01:12:22.375 --> 01:12:25.375
we can’t even say
if she remembers the entire incident.

01:12:25.458 --> 01:12:26.583
- Oh my God!
- Yeah!

01:12:27.583 --> 01:12:28.583
Thank you, Doctor.

01:12:28.833 --> 01:12:30.000
That’s all, Your Honor.

01:12:30.375 --> 01:12:31.583
Bail rejected.

01:12:31.666 --> 01:12:32.625
Sir!

01:12:33.291 --> 01:12:36.291
Sir, what’s going on?
He’s not getting bail.

01:12:36.375 --> 01:12:37.291
What can I say?

01:12:37.375 --> 01:12:40.125
Can’t you see how hard I’m trying
for bail? It’s just not working.

01:12:40.208 --> 01:12:41.041
Trying?

01:12:41.125 --> 01:12:44.041
You promised you’d get him released,
and now you’re speaking indifferently.

01:12:44.125 --> 01:12:46.458
Why are you shouting at me?

01:12:46.541 --> 01:12:48.750
Don’t act like your friend
did something great!

01:12:48.833 --> 01:12:50.750
Do you understand
the mistake your friend made?

01:12:50.833 --> 01:12:52.500
No one can save him in this case.

01:12:52.583 --> 01:12:55.000
I can only try to reduce the punishment.

01:12:55.083 --> 01:12:57.625
You don’t know how hard
I’m pleading with the judge for that.

01:12:57.708 --> 01:12:59.625
And you’re raising your voice at me!

01:13:02.916 --> 01:13:04.000
What’s this, brother?

01:13:06.125 --> 01:13:07.916
The closing statements of both parties.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:08.916
Your Honor.

01:13:09.208 --> 01:13:10.958
Neglecting studies at young age,

01:13:11.083 --> 01:13:14.625
these jackasses who take up odd jobs
for just 200 or 300 rupees--

01:13:17.083 --> 01:13:18.583
Sorry for my language, Your Honor.

01:13:19.125 --> 01:13:20.250
All I meant to say is,

01:13:21.041 --> 01:13:27.958
the judgment you pass on Chandu
and others who chase and trap girls,

01:13:28.708 --> 01:13:30.041
should be a lesson.

01:13:30.791 --> 01:13:31.833
That’s all, Your Honor.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.541
The defense's closing statement.

01:13:34.625 --> 01:13:36.791
Considering the young age of the accused,

01:13:36.875 --> 01:13:38.916
and the promising future
he has ahead of him,

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.083
I urge the Court to exercise compassion
in its judgment.

01:13:42.166 --> 01:13:43.166
That’s all, Your Honor.

01:13:43.541 --> 01:13:45.541
The prosecution's evidence in this case,

01:13:45.875 --> 01:13:48.916
witnesses, and defense arguments

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.458
have been thoroughly examined.

01:13:51.750 --> 01:13:53.583
Taking everything into consideration,

01:13:53.666 --> 01:13:57.083
the final judgment of this case
will be pronounced in the open court,

01:13:57.458 --> 01:13:59.500
at the next hearing, dated

01:14:00.875 --> 01:14:05.333
29th July 2013 at 10 a.m.

01:14:19.291 --> 01:14:21.000
- Tell me, Teja.
- Good evening, sir.

01:14:21.208 --> 01:14:23.750
- Are you coming to the office?
- No, Teja.

01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:27.333
I’m in Mangalagiri
regarding the land dispute case.

01:14:27.416 --> 01:14:28.916
It'll be late by the time I return.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.333
I won’t be coming to the office.

01:14:31.041 --> 01:14:34.625
Sir, the people from Vizag
have been waiting for you for a long time.

01:14:35.291 --> 01:14:37.291
Please ask them to come back
in the morning.

01:14:37.833 --> 01:14:38.791
Teja!

01:14:39.750 --> 01:14:41.916
I need to visit
the collector’s office tomorrow.

01:14:43.625 --> 01:14:47.375
Okay, I’ll come and have a look
at the case file early in the morning.

01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:49.416
Ask them to come around 10 a.m.

01:14:49.958 --> 01:14:51.000
I’ll inform them, sir.

01:14:54.791 --> 01:14:57.666
He has asked you to come back
at 10 a.m. tomorrow.

01:15:01.375 --> 01:15:02.333
Okay, sir.

01:15:13.375 --> 01:15:14.916
- Teja!
- Sir!

01:15:17.875 --> 01:15:19.416
We aren’t taking up this case.

01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:21.250
Please inform them.

01:15:21.541 --> 01:15:23.583
Sir, there’s a chance
we can win this case.

01:15:23.666 --> 01:15:26.666
We can raise a benefit of the doubt
against the police--

01:15:27.625 --> 01:15:30.375
Whatever we do,
we cannot deliver the justice they need.

01:15:30.583 --> 01:15:32.541
It’s not that easy to get that boy out.

01:15:32.666 --> 01:15:34.833
This case is not as easy
as it looks on paper.

01:15:34.916 --> 01:15:36.750
Don't waste their time.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.083
Tell them to leave.

01:15:38.333 --> 01:15:39.666
I'm off to the collector's office.

01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:41.291
- Tell them it’s not possible.
- Sir...

01:15:41.458 --> 01:15:42.875
If we get a recall

01:15:42.958 --> 01:15:44.833
- for the witness cross-examination…
- Teja!

01:15:46.166 --> 01:15:47.541
POCSO is different.

01:15:51.083 --> 01:15:54.083
We can win this case.
I don’t know why he’s not taking it up.

01:15:54.166 --> 01:15:56.250
- Who knows what he saw in that case.
- Brother!

01:15:56.375 --> 01:15:57.791
- I don’t understand--
- Brother!

01:15:58.125 --> 01:15:59.291
- Take the sweets.
- Koti!

01:15:59.375 --> 01:16:00.333
What’s the matter?

01:16:00.416 --> 01:16:02.833
- Is your marriage fixed?
- No. My boss assigned me a case.

01:16:02.916 --> 01:16:04.958
Congratulations, Koti!
What is that case about?

01:16:05.041 --> 01:16:08.166
Someone made a post supporting
the rapist in the Nirbhaya case.

01:16:08.291 --> 01:16:09.875
Now someone else has filed a case
against that person.

01:16:09.958 --> 01:16:11.458
- I’ve been assigned that case.
- Who’s that?

01:16:11.583 --> 01:16:13.625
- Why would he support a rapist?
- Why do I care?

01:16:13.708 --> 01:16:16.416
- I just needed my first case!
- All the best! Argue well.

01:16:21.625 --> 01:16:23.500
We cannot deliver the justice they need.

01:16:24.125 --> 01:16:25.958
The judgement will be announced
on Monday.

01:16:26.625 --> 01:16:27.875
POCSO is different.

01:16:30.291 --> 01:16:33.083
He has been in remand for 78 days.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.583
This case is not as easy
as it looks on paper.

01:16:38.916 --> 01:16:42.333
- Take one more, brother.
- Congratulations, Koti.

01:16:42.541 --> 01:16:43.833
Do well! Okay?

01:16:44.291 --> 01:16:45.625
You must win this case!

01:16:46.083 --> 01:16:47.833
Our clients are here. See you later.

01:16:48.125 --> 01:16:49.208
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:16:51.708 --> 01:16:52.833
Please come.

01:16:54.041 --> 01:16:58.000
My boss studied the file,
and he gave it to me and just left.

01:16:58.083 --> 01:17:00.416
- He left?
- Don’t worry.

01:17:00.541 --> 01:17:04.166
He is taking up this case.
He’s endorsed me for this case.

01:17:04.333 --> 01:17:06.833
I’m going to handle it
under his guidance.

01:17:08.583 --> 01:17:10.583
I’ll appear in court on his behalf.

01:17:11.916 --> 01:17:13.416
Shall we start in the evening?

01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:15.375
I’ve got some work in court to finish.

01:17:15.625 --> 01:17:17.458
- I'll meet you later.
- Okay, sir.

01:17:18.166 --> 01:17:19.958
Finally, they accepted our case.

01:17:20.041 --> 01:17:21.916
What work do you have in court on Sunday?

01:17:22.791 --> 01:17:25.583
- It’s a lie.
- I just heard a bigger lie than that.

01:17:26.083 --> 01:17:27.333
What do you want me to do?

01:17:27.416 --> 01:17:29.125
Didn't you hear
the question the boss asked?

01:17:29.208 --> 01:17:30.500
Do you know the answer?

01:17:30.583 --> 01:17:31.666
Not just you and I…

01:17:31.916 --> 01:17:35.583
When I searched Google for the answer,
I found out it's called trolley problem.

01:17:35.666 --> 01:17:36.625
Trolley problem?

01:17:36.708 --> 01:17:38.291
Do you know Google's answer for it?

01:17:38.375 --> 01:17:40.041
It says there’s no answer
to this scenario.

01:17:40.125 --> 01:17:43.416
Apparently, we can write any answer
we want based on common sense.

01:17:44.583 --> 01:17:47.708
He asked a hypothetical question
that even Google couldn’t answer,

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.333
and demanded the correct answer
in exchange for a case.

01:17:50.416 --> 01:17:53.500
It clearly shows he has no intention
of assigning a case to me.

01:17:54.083 --> 01:17:57.166
That’s a POCSO case. It hasn’t even been
a year since the law was enacted.

01:17:57.250 --> 01:17:59.416
Even top lawyers are backing off
just at the mention of POCSO.

01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:02.541
I believe I can handle this case, Lahari.

01:18:03.208 --> 01:18:06.916
If I don’t go to court tomorrow,
that guy will get sentenced to 14 years.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:10.041
If I go, at least I’ll be happy
that I did my best to stop it.

01:18:10.291 --> 01:18:11.333
If I win,

01:18:11.416 --> 01:18:14.666
it'll prove Mr. Mohan Rao wrong
for brushing it off as unwinnable.

01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:17.625
This lie will disappear
in the face of that victory.

01:18:27.333 --> 01:18:29.833
{\an8}♪ Truth alone triumphs ♪

01:18:29.958 --> 01:18:32.333

01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:34.791

01:19:01.416 --> 01:19:02.250
Sir.

01:19:04.250 --> 01:19:05.958
I'll look into it after the judgment.

01:19:06.041 --> 01:19:07.916
- It's related to the current case, sir.
- What?

01:19:08.875 --> 01:19:11.000
A memo of appearance
so late into this case?

01:19:11.375 --> 01:19:13.375
Who are these G. Mohan Rao
and Ch. Surya Teja?

01:19:14.083 --> 01:19:15.500
It's me, Your Honor.

01:19:15.875 --> 01:19:16.875
What's this, mister?

01:19:17.125 --> 01:19:19.041
What's your intention behind
filing memo of appearance?

01:19:19.125 --> 01:19:21.708
My Lord, I would request
the Honorable Court

01:19:21.791 --> 01:19:23.416
to conduct a retrial in this case.

01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:24.458
A retrial?

01:19:27.666 --> 01:19:28.708
Yes, Your Honor.

01:19:28.958 --> 01:19:31.666
- What's this Mr…
- Surya Teja.

01:19:31.791 --> 01:19:33.666
Surya Teja, did you file this memo

01:19:33.750 --> 01:19:36.166
knowing today is the final judgment
in this case?

01:19:37.333 --> 01:19:38.166
Yes, Your Honor.

01:19:38.250 --> 01:19:39.583
Why did you do so?

01:19:39.750 --> 01:19:41.958
This case is completely
in favor of the victim.

01:19:42.041 --> 01:19:44.916
And this court believes
that the accused is proven guilty.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.333
Asking for a retrial
to defend this case at this stage,

01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:50.875
is just a waste of this court's time.

01:19:52.041 --> 01:19:54.458
My Lord, let me try once. Please.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:00.208
People complain that over 50 million cases
are pending in our courts.

01:20:00.541 --> 01:20:05.750
And here you are asking to retry
a case that's reached the judgment stage.

01:20:05.875 --> 01:20:07.833
My Lord, with all due respect…

01:20:08.208 --> 01:20:10.166
You mentioned 50 million cases.

01:20:10.583 --> 01:20:13.500
But actually,
it's an injustice that's happened

01:20:13.583 --> 01:20:15.958
to 50 million people, Your Honor.

01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:24.500
August 4th.

01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:28.250
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- Next.

01:20:30.041 --> 01:20:32.208
What's this hassle on judgment day?
Who is he?

01:20:32.333 --> 01:20:35.583
Who he is doesn't matter, Manga.
Nobody can win this case.

01:20:36.333 --> 01:20:39.083
We have to win this case
at any cost, Damu.

01:20:39.166 --> 01:20:40.666
We've already won the case, Manga.

01:20:40.791 --> 01:20:43.166
Only the official judgment is pending.

01:20:44.916 --> 01:20:46.166
TRUTH ALONE TRIUMPHS

01:20:51.375 --> 01:20:52.458
Yes, Mr. Teja.

01:20:52.875 --> 01:20:54.125
Proceed with your argument.

01:20:54.208 --> 01:20:56.666
My Lord, before presenting my arguments,

01:20:56.916 --> 01:21:00.208
I'd like to question
our prosecutor Mr. Damu.

01:21:03.250 --> 01:21:04.083
Continue.

01:21:04.875 --> 01:21:07.166
Mr. Damu, did you stop anywhere

01:21:07.250 --> 01:21:09.625
on your commute to court
from home this morning?

01:21:10.875 --> 01:21:12.291
I stopped at traffic signals.

01:21:13.583 --> 01:21:14.625
Okay. Anywhere else?

01:21:15.125 --> 01:21:17.375
- Where else would I stop?
- Recall properly and tell me.

01:21:19.250 --> 01:21:20.208
Okay.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.458
I stopped at a petrol station.

01:21:22.625 --> 01:21:24.083
Why did you stop there?

01:21:24.250 --> 01:21:26.541
For the same reason
anyone else would stop there.

01:21:26.708 --> 01:21:28.000
To fill petrol.

01:21:28.083 --> 01:21:29.875
- You drive a diesel car, don't you?
- Diesel--

01:21:32.666 --> 01:21:35.083
Petrol stations don't sell diesel? Okay.

01:21:35.541 --> 01:21:37.000
I know where it's coming from.

01:21:37.625 --> 01:21:39.375
You have been stalking me.

01:21:40.041 --> 01:21:41.083
Okay, Your Honor.

01:21:41.291 --> 01:21:44.458
I filled a bottle of petrol
at the petrol station.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.500
- So what?
- Why fill it in a bottle, sir?

01:21:47.916 --> 01:21:48.833
Why?

01:21:48.916 --> 01:21:52.416
Because you fought with
the owner of the grocery store

01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:54.416
that's at the end of your street.

01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:55.958
And to exact revenge on him

01:21:56.041 --> 01:21:59.958
you bought petrol this morning
to burn down his store.

01:22:00.041 --> 01:22:02.916
- Am I right, sir?
- What kind of foolish story is this?

01:22:03.333 --> 01:22:05.833
- I object, Your Honor!
- Why did you buy petrol, then?

01:22:05.916 --> 01:22:07.583
Is there any other purpose for petrol

01:22:07.666 --> 01:22:10.166
apart from using it
in a vehicle or burning something?

01:22:10.250 --> 01:22:11.958
Yeah. Using it in a vehicle!

01:22:12.291 --> 01:22:13.291
Okay. Okay!

01:22:13.708 --> 01:22:15.833
Your Honor, I also own a two-wheeler.

01:22:15.916 --> 01:22:18.291
It has no fuel.
I couldn't drive it to the station.

01:22:18.375 --> 01:22:21.291
That's why I went to the petrol station
in my diesel car,

01:22:21.375 --> 01:22:24.041
and bought petrol in a bottle
for my two-wheeler. Is that clear?

01:22:24.125 --> 01:22:26.916
No, My Lord. Everything he said is a lie.

01:22:27.208 --> 01:22:28.708
- What?
- He bought petrol

01:22:28.791 --> 01:22:31.333
with the sole intention
of burning down that store.

01:22:31.416 --> 01:22:32.625
Well, wait! Wait!

01:22:33.458 --> 01:22:37.000
Your Honor, I did have
a fight with that store owner.

01:22:37.166 --> 01:22:39.916
I also bought petrol in a bottle.

01:22:40.916 --> 01:22:43.458
But… where is the crime here?

01:22:46.708 --> 01:22:51.250
It is a crime only if I throw petrol
on the owner and set him on fire! Right?

01:22:51.916 --> 01:22:55.333
I'm just trying to explain
the law to my fellow lawyer.

01:22:56.708 --> 01:22:58.166
Buying petrol is not a crime.

01:22:58.250 --> 01:23:00.208
It's a crime only if I use it
to burn something.

01:23:00.291 --> 01:23:02.000
Exactly, Your Honor!

01:23:02.666 --> 01:23:04.291
Buying a condom is not a crime.

01:23:04.375 --> 01:23:06.000
It's a crime only if sex occurs.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.458
We have a witness for the purchase
of condoms on that day.

01:23:14.541 --> 01:23:17.125
Nobody has told us
what happened after that.

01:23:17.583 --> 01:23:21.750
Now, I'd like to call upon
the next witness, Chitti.

01:23:27.166 --> 01:23:29.625
Chitti, tell me what happened that day.

01:23:30.125 --> 01:23:32.083
- Jaabili is calling! Come quickly!
- Coming, bro.

01:23:32.416 --> 01:23:34.541
Brother, give me a packet.

01:23:36.125 --> 01:23:39.416
Dude! This would be
the best gift at this hour.

01:23:39.958 --> 01:23:42.083
You creep!
Is this all you can think about?

01:23:42.166 --> 01:23:43.458
Nobody thinks like you.

01:23:43.541 --> 01:23:46.041
You can walk home.
I won't give you a lift!

01:23:46.291 --> 01:23:47.666
Dude! Dude!

01:23:52.583 --> 01:23:55.833
My Lord, there is no police record
of the accused Chandrasekhar

01:23:55.916 --> 01:23:58.916
having a condom at the time
of his arrest, Your Honor.

01:23:59.625 --> 01:24:04.750
Besides, Chitti's version proves that
the accused threw away the condoms.

01:24:04.958 --> 01:24:06.458
Hello, my dear defense lawyer!

01:24:06.708 --> 01:24:10.583
The case is not about whether he bought
the condoms or he threw it away.

01:24:11.458 --> 01:24:13.000
She's a minor, My Lord.

01:24:13.875 --> 01:24:16.791
He was caught red-handed after
blackmailing her to go home with him.

01:24:16.875 --> 01:24:19.416
We should be talking about that,
not all this.

01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:22.416
Your Honor, they call it blackmail
when I talk about condoms.

01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:24.750
And they bring up condoms
when I talk about blackmail!

01:24:27.291 --> 01:24:28.625
All right, My Lord.

01:24:29.208 --> 01:24:31.916
With your permission,
I'd like to call upon

01:24:32.041 --> 01:24:34.375
LW6, Devudu Babu.

01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:39.125
Devudu Babu! Devudu Babu! Devudu Babu!

01:24:39.208 --> 01:24:40.208
- Mr. Devudu Babu.
- Sir?

01:24:40.416 --> 01:24:41.666
On May 9th,

01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:44.458
Ramu Naidu, Appala Swamy, and you

01:24:44.750 --> 01:24:47.208
visited the Simhachalam temple.

01:24:47.458 --> 01:24:51.375
And you were waiting at the bus terminal
to catch a bus back to your village.

01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:54.500
And at around 12:15 p.m.,

01:24:54.708 --> 01:24:56.625
you saw this boy, Chandrasekhar,

01:24:56.708 --> 01:25:00.458
forcefully taking
Muthyalaiah’s granddaughter on his bike.

01:25:00.541 --> 01:25:01.958
- Is that correct?
- Yes, sir.

01:25:02.875 --> 01:25:06.166
- How long did it take to see the deity?
- I object, Your Honor!

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.250
Why are we talking about seeing the deity
or the rituals at the temple?

01:25:10.333 --> 01:25:12.083
How is it relevant to this case?

01:25:12.541 --> 01:25:13.625
What is this, Mr. Teja?

01:25:13.708 --> 01:25:15.000
It is relevant, Your Honor!

01:25:15.333 --> 01:25:17.833
Mr. Damu will understand
if he exercises some patience.

01:25:18.708 --> 01:25:19.708
Continue.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.541
Mr. Devudu Babu,
how long did it take to see the deity?

01:25:22.791 --> 01:25:24.250
Around one and a half hours.

01:25:24.791 --> 01:25:26.083
One and a half hours.

01:25:27.125 --> 01:25:29.625
Did you take the stairs or a bus
to the hilltop?

01:25:29.833 --> 01:25:30.750
We took the stairs.

01:25:30.833 --> 01:25:32.375
How long did that take?

01:25:32.541 --> 01:25:34.416
- One and a half hours.
- Okay.

01:25:35.666 --> 01:25:39.000
It takes two hours to get to Simhachalam
from your village, right?

01:25:39.083 --> 01:25:40.416
- Yes, sir.
- Yes?

01:25:40.625 --> 01:25:44.083
It took 90 minutes to climb the stairs,
and another 90 minutes to see the deity.

01:25:44.333 --> 01:25:45.708
That’s five hours in total.

01:25:45.791 --> 01:25:48.208
If you were at the bus terminal
by 12:15 p.m.,

01:25:48.333 --> 01:25:50.000
that means you were
already halfway back home.

01:25:50.083 --> 01:25:51.500
Which means you'd traveled another hour.

01:25:51.583 --> 01:25:52.875
So a total of six hours.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:57.625
Now, what time in the morning
did you leave your village Tagarapuvalasa

01:25:57.708 --> 01:25:59.625
to go to Simhachalam?

01:26:06.875 --> 01:26:08.041
At 6 a.m., sir.

01:26:08.416 --> 01:26:10.583
- Morning 6 o'clock?
- Yes, sir.

01:26:12.458 --> 01:26:13.666
Thank you, Mr. Devudu Babu.

01:26:13.750 --> 01:26:15.041
- You can go.
- Okay, sir.

01:26:15.125 --> 01:26:17.458
My Lord, I now request to call upon

01:26:17.583 --> 01:26:20.791
LW7, Mr. Ramu Naidu, to the witness stand.

01:26:22.583 --> 01:26:26.000
Mr. Ramu Naidu, what time
did you leave your village that day

01:26:26.083 --> 01:26:28.000
to go to Simhachalam?

01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:29.458
We…

01:26:30.416 --> 01:26:31.625
The time…

01:26:35.833 --> 01:26:39.291
Okay. While returning to your village
from Simhachalam,

01:26:39.791 --> 01:26:43.208
you saw this boy taking
Muthyalaiah’s granddaughter on a bike.

01:26:43.291 --> 01:26:44.875
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

01:26:45.416 --> 01:26:48.333
To go back to your village,
you had to reach Simhachalam first, right?

01:26:48.416 --> 01:26:51.583
So, I'm asking,
what time did you leave for Simhachalam?

01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:54.333
Mr. Ramu Naidu, please tell us.

01:26:54.625 --> 01:26:55.625
Around 8 a.m.

01:26:56.833 --> 01:26:58.750
At 8 a.m.?

01:26:58.916 --> 01:27:01.375
- Yes, sir.
- How long did it take to see the deity?

01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:04.833
- About half an hour.
- Half an hour. 30 minutes! Wow!

01:27:05.583 --> 01:27:07.833
Thank you, Mr. Ramu Naidu. Please wait.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Mr. Appala Swamy,

01:27:09.166 --> 01:27:10.583
on May 9th,

01:27:10.666 --> 01:27:14.416
you saw this boy taking
Muthyalaiah’s granddaughter on his bike.

01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:16.583
- Is that correct?
- Yes, sir. I saw them.

01:27:16.833 --> 01:27:19.125
The man was wearing a yellow shirt.

01:27:19.291 --> 01:27:20.833
The girl was in a pink dress.

01:27:20.916 --> 01:27:22.291
The bike was black.

01:27:22.375 --> 01:27:24.208
The colors aren’t really relevant now.

01:27:24.291 --> 01:27:25.208
Please tell me.

01:27:25.541 --> 01:27:29.583
At what time did you leave your village
to go to Simhachalam?

01:27:32.041 --> 01:27:34.166
How long did it take to see the deity?

01:27:38.083 --> 01:27:41.625
My Lord, in a way,
Devudu Babu and Ramu Naidu are better.

01:27:41.708 --> 01:27:43.458
At least they tried to say something.

01:27:43.541 --> 01:27:44.875
But him…

01:27:45.125 --> 01:27:46.041
Your Honor!

01:27:46.375 --> 01:27:51.375
These three claim they saw a boy taking
a girl from their village on a bike.

01:27:51.750 --> 01:27:56.000
They remember the color
of their clothes and the bike.

01:27:56.333 --> 01:28:00.416
But somehow,
they all recall different times

01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:04.500
for when they left for Simhachalam
and how long it took to see the deity.

01:28:04.791 --> 01:28:06.333
That's surprising, Your Honor.

01:28:06.666 --> 01:28:10.125
If you're as surprised as I am,
let me show you something, My Lord.

01:28:11.791 --> 01:28:13.916
Your Honor, I would like to present

01:28:14.041 --> 01:28:17.125
a video statement
given by the victim’s friend.

01:28:21.750 --> 01:28:25.791
My Lord, this is a statement from Nithya,
the victim Jaabili’s close friend.

01:28:26.041 --> 01:28:30.083
She explains what happened on May 9th
after their EAMCET class.

01:28:30.541 --> 01:28:33.250
Since her parents didn’t want her
to attend court,

01:28:33.333 --> 01:28:35.375
they recorded this video statement.

01:28:36.375 --> 01:28:37.583
My name is Nithya.

01:28:37.750 --> 01:28:40.083
Jaabili and I have been classmates
since 11th grade.

01:28:40.250 --> 01:28:42.583
On May 9th, after our EAMCET class,

01:28:42.958 --> 01:28:45.500
we took an auto-rickshaw to Maddilapalem.

01:28:45.625 --> 01:28:47.916
From there, we walked together.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:51.666
I went to my house and she went
to my neighbor Chandu’s house.

01:28:53.291 --> 01:28:56.541
My Lord, if we examine
Nithya’s video statement,

01:28:56.916 --> 01:29:00.791
it’s clear that the victim Jaabili
never went to the bus station.

01:29:01.083 --> 01:29:02.791
And based on my cross-examination,

01:29:02.875 --> 01:29:05.458
it's clear that these three
never went to Simhachalam.

01:29:05.541 --> 01:29:09.625
So, when did the accused Chandrashekar,
wearing a yellow shirt,

01:29:09.833 --> 01:29:12.541
blackmail Jaabili,
who was in a pink dress,

01:29:12.625 --> 01:29:14.375
and abduct her on his black bike?

01:29:14.625 --> 01:29:17.708
I fail to understand this, Your Honor.

01:29:18.583 --> 01:29:24.666
Sections 366A, 354A, 354B, 354C, and 354D.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.458
These charges arise from twisting
a half-truth from the drugstore

01:29:28.541 --> 01:29:31.750
and inventing a story about an abduction
from the bus station!

01:29:31.916 --> 01:29:35.458
My Lord, with all due respect,
I would request the Honorable Court

01:29:35.541 --> 01:29:38.125
to dismiss all these charges

01:29:38.208 --> 01:29:41.250
against my client,
the accused Chandrasekhar, Your Honor.

01:29:44.916 --> 01:29:49.250
Does the prosecution have any other source
to support this incident?

01:29:51.166 --> 01:29:52.916
I need some time, Your Honor.

01:29:56.833 --> 01:29:58.041
10/8.

01:29:58.791 --> 01:30:00.333
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- Thank you, My Lord.

01:30:01.666 --> 01:30:02.916
- Sir!
- Yes?

01:30:03.166 --> 01:30:04.666
Can we apply for bail?

01:30:06.333 --> 01:30:09.333
This is a very sensitive case, Reddy.
Getting bail won’t be easy.

01:30:09.500 --> 01:30:12.583
We should focus on winning the case,
not just getting bail.

01:30:13.333 --> 01:30:14.541
- Okay, sir.
- See you soon.

01:30:16.250 --> 01:30:17.291
Well done.

01:30:17.916 --> 01:30:19.833
Great cross-examination, Mr.--

01:30:19.958 --> 01:30:20.875
- Teja.
- Teja!

01:30:21.291 --> 01:30:22.791
- Nice.
- Thank you, sir.

01:30:23.125 --> 01:30:25.458
- Hey! Get two cups of tea.
- No thanks, sir.

01:30:27.291 --> 01:30:29.541
There are some offers
you just shouldn’t refuse.

01:30:31.041 --> 01:30:34.125
I don’t know how much they’re paying you
to argue this case.

01:30:34.583 --> 01:30:37.250
I don’t know what you stand to gain
if you win it either.

01:30:37.333 --> 01:30:40.083
But how much would it take for you
to drop it?

01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:45.416
Who’s your client, Teja?

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:47.041
Who is he?

01:30:47.708 --> 01:30:49.500
He’s just a watchman’s son.

01:30:49.958 --> 01:30:51.458
A nobody.

01:30:52.958 --> 01:30:57.375
And yet, for his case,
you’re rejecting my offer--

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Damu,

01:31:17.916 --> 01:31:19.958
if we somehow lose this case,

01:31:21.375 --> 01:31:24.333
I can’t bear people
gossiping about my loss.

01:31:26.041 --> 01:31:27.125
What should we do?

01:31:30.708 --> 01:31:31.791
I’ll tell you.

01:31:34.500 --> 01:31:35.958
- Tell me, Teja!
- Lahari!

01:31:36.416 --> 01:31:38.666
- We’ve almost won this case.
- Very good.

01:31:39.208 --> 01:31:40.916
How was today’s hearing?

01:31:48.375 --> 01:31:49.375
Prosecution.

01:31:49.958 --> 01:31:50.958
Your Honor!

01:31:51.583 --> 01:31:54.250
We received crucial evidence last evening.

01:31:54.541 --> 01:31:57.125
I request you to examine it.

01:31:57.333 --> 01:31:58.208
Sir.

01:32:18.708 --> 01:32:21.083
Respected defense lawyer,
please take a look.

01:32:22.916 --> 01:32:23.958
One minute.

01:32:24.250 --> 01:32:25.208
Chandu!

01:32:26.125 --> 01:32:28.958
Come. You should also see
the great work you’ve done.

01:32:30.041 --> 01:32:32.708
Come. Let's not waste the Court's time.

01:33:01.333 --> 01:33:02.333
Your Honor!

01:33:03.708 --> 01:33:07.791
On May 4th,
exactly five days before the arrest,

01:33:08.291 --> 01:33:10.250
Jaabili attended a wedding, Your Honor.

01:33:11.833 --> 01:33:14.416
Chandu, who followed her everywhere,

01:33:14.625 --> 01:33:16.833
also went to the wedding to meet her.

01:33:17.041 --> 01:33:18.500
And whatever he said to her,

01:33:18.625 --> 01:33:20.666
this video speaks volumes.

01:33:20.750 --> 01:33:25.250
And on May 9th, around 10 a.m.,
the victim’s mother received this video.

01:33:25.416 --> 01:33:28.041
She panicked. She didn’t know what to do.

01:33:28.541 --> 01:33:31.125
She was wondering whom she should tell.

01:33:31.666 --> 01:33:34.666
Just then, she got a phone call
to add to her troubles.

01:33:34.791 --> 01:33:37.166
She heard that
her daughter was taken on a bike.

01:33:38.125 --> 01:33:41.083
She didn’t know what to do.
So she filed a police complaint.

01:33:41.750 --> 01:33:43.000
But, Your Honor,

01:33:43.416 --> 01:33:48.625
she withheld this video to protect
her daughter's reputation in society.

01:33:49.625 --> 01:33:50.875
She didn't submit it to the police.

01:33:50.958 --> 01:33:54.000
Because she firmly believed
the accused would be punished

01:33:54.083 --> 01:33:56.083
for ruining her daughter's life.

01:33:57.375 --> 01:34:01.416
You know what happened after that.
Powerful people tried to derail this case.

01:34:01.583 --> 01:34:03.541
The incident happened three months ago.

01:34:03.625 --> 01:34:06.375
How much can the witnesses
really remember? They got confused.

01:34:06.458 --> 01:34:09.666
Fearing that the wrongdoer
might escape punishment,

01:34:10.750 --> 01:34:15.791
this mother did the ultimate sacrifice
that no one else would have done.

01:34:16.208 --> 01:34:20.458
She reluctantly brought
this video forward.

01:34:20.625 --> 01:34:21.583
Why?

01:34:22.208 --> 01:34:26.458
Because she doesn’t want another girl
to suffer her daughter's fate.

01:34:26.666 --> 01:34:30.166
If you can honor her request for justice,

01:34:31.125 --> 01:34:36.375
I will revise the charges
and submit a new charge sheet.

01:34:36.583 --> 01:34:39.250
To do that, I request the Court
to give me some time.

01:34:39.416 --> 01:34:40.666
That's all, Your Honor.

01:34:44.333 --> 01:34:46.000
- 17/8.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

01:34:57.708 --> 01:34:59.208
Please listen, sir.

01:35:03.333 --> 01:35:05.375
The drugstore might be a half-truth.

01:35:06.625 --> 01:35:08.750
The bus station might be a complete lie.

01:35:10.083 --> 01:35:11.666
But this video…

01:35:12.083 --> 01:35:13.416
is completely true.

01:35:13.833 --> 01:35:16.166
Show me what you got now!

01:35:18.958 --> 01:35:19.916
Sir.

01:35:20.166 --> 01:35:22.000
Please, hear me out.

01:35:22.791 --> 01:35:23.791
Let's go.

01:35:23.875 --> 01:35:25.208
- Sir!
- I said, let's go.

01:35:25.375 --> 01:35:26.291
Sir!

01:35:26.916 --> 01:35:28.166
- Sir!
- Move it.

01:35:28.250 --> 01:35:29.291
Sir...

01:35:30.125 --> 01:35:32.208
Sir, please listen to me once.

01:35:45.083 --> 01:35:46.750
- Sir! Sir!
- What do you want?

01:35:48.500 --> 01:35:49.708
You people cheated me.

01:35:50.416 --> 01:35:51.333
You betrayed me.

01:35:51.416 --> 01:35:53.375
Sir, we didn't know about the video.

01:35:53.541 --> 01:35:54.583
But he did.

01:35:55.041 --> 01:35:56.250
He knew, didn't he?

01:35:56.791 --> 01:35:58.041
He should have told me.

01:35:59.583 --> 01:36:01.375
Keep your case to yourself.

01:36:03.583 --> 01:36:06.458
That junior lawyer
won't be here for the next hearing.

01:36:07.208 --> 01:36:09.500
Make sure the final judgment
is given on that day.

01:36:09.583 --> 01:36:10.541
- Got it?
- I'll take care of it.

01:36:10.625 --> 01:36:13.125
- Just relax.
- Where did that CCTV footage come from?

01:36:13.333 --> 01:36:15.625
How did it suddenly show up?

01:36:17.416 --> 01:36:18.875
It wasn't sudden.

01:36:19.291 --> 01:36:20.708
That was where it all started.

01:36:20.791 --> 01:36:22.375
MANGAPATHI RICE MILL

01:36:23.791 --> 01:36:25.000
What’s up, Madhava?

01:36:25.083 --> 01:36:27.875
You said you had something
important to share. What is it?

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.666
My sister-in-law's necklace
went missing at that wedding.

01:36:30.750 --> 01:36:32.958
While reviewing the CCTV footage,

01:36:33.125 --> 01:36:35.208
we came across something else.

01:36:35.458 --> 01:36:36.375
Take a look.

01:36:49.833 --> 01:36:53.125
I didn’t know whom to inform
in their family, so I came to you.

01:37:02.875 --> 01:37:04.958
All right then. I'll leave now.

01:37:07.291 --> 01:37:08.708
Leave your laptop here.

01:37:18.875 --> 01:37:20.541
- Bring the rest of the bags--
- Hey!

01:37:22.791 --> 01:37:24.250
- Brother-in-law?
- Where is Jaabili?

01:37:24.333 --> 01:37:25.625
She went to her EAMCET class.

01:37:25.708 --> 01:37:28.250
- What’s her number?
- 9849…

01:37:29.333 --> 01:37:30.291
What’s wrong?

01:37:30.666 --> 01:37:32.625
- Get back to work.
- Okay.

01:37:35.291 --> 01:37:37.375
- Tell me.
- I'm sharing a number with you.

01:37:37.708 --> 01:37:40.375
Track who received the most calls from it

01:37:40.458 --> 01:37:42.083
and give me their name and address.

01:37:45.208 --> 01:37:47.250
- Where are you?
- I'm at Dhaba Garden, sir!

01:37:47.333 --> 01:37:49.208
I'll give you a task. Finish it fast.

01:37:49.458 --> 01:37:50.375
Okay, sir.

01:37:52.583 --> 01:37:54.791
- Tell me.
- The number that received the most calls

01:37:54.875 --> 01:37:56.708
belongs to a Chandrasekhar.

01:37:57.083 --> 01:37:58.416
The address is…

01:38:06.791 --> 01:38:08.791
- Where are you?
- Urvashi Junction, sir.

01:38:16.041 --> 01:38:16.916
Hey!

01:38:17.791 --> 01:38:19.750
- Get in the car. Get in!
- Where are we going?

01:38:36.666 --> 01:38:39.333
Dude, there’s no better gift
than this right now.

01:38:39.583 --> 01:38:41.708
You can walk home.
I won't give you a lift.

01:38:41.791 --> 01:38:42.958
Dude! Dude!

01:38:53.416 --> 01:38:54.875
Mrs. Seetha Ratnam!

01:38:56.250 --> 01:38:58.083
Mr. Muthyalaiah! Come here!

01:39:00.375 --> 01:39:02.291
- Where are we going?
- You’ll find out.

01:39:03.708 --> 01:39:05.125
Hey! Where are you off to?

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.125
- I was getting the shawl.
- Not needed!

01:39:08.250 --> 01:39:09.125
Come now.

01:39:40.083 --> 01:39:41.000
Watch this.

01:39:44.041 --> 01:39:45.541
Who’s that? Jaabili…

01:39:46.041 --> 01:39:48.625
- Who's that guy?
- His name is Chandrasekhar.

01:39:49.250 --> 01:39:50.500
He lives in this house.

01:39:51.875 --> 01:39:53.083
What are you staring at?

01:39:53.375 --> 01:39:54.791
Trying to locate the house?

01:39:55.333 --> 01:39:58.208
You know the shed we provide
for our watchmen?

01:39:58.833 --> 01:40:00.500
That's what his house looks like.

01:40:01.083 --> 01:40:03.166
Our Jaabili is there with him right now.

01:40:03.458 --> 01:40:05.666
If she's there, why are we still here?

01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:06.833
- Let’s go inside.
- Wait!

01:40:07.333 --> 01:40:09.416
Wait for some time. They’re coming.

01:40:09.666 --> 01:40:10.583
Who are coming?

01:40:11.750 --> 01:40:12.833
Let’s go in now.

01:40:20.041 --> 01:40:22.625
Please make sure this doesn't get out,
Son-in-law.

01:40:24.208 --> 01:40:28.416
As per my father-in-law’s request,
I kept this video hidden until now.

01:40:29.541 --> 01:40:31.125
But there's no other choice now.

01:40:31.416 --> 01:40:32.458
Shall I leave now?

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Okay, let's go.

01:40:39.500 --> 01:40:41.666
What happened in today’s hearing?

01:40:41.791 --> 01:40:43.875
- Nothing much.
- Why do you sound downcast?

01:40:44.250 --> 01:40:45.250
What happened?

01:40:46.041 --> 01:40:48.208
Nothing. I’m going home.
I'll talk to you later.

01:40:48.291 --> 01:40:50.375
Going home? Why now?

01:40:51.250 --> 01:40:52.208
Hello?

01:40:57.208 --> 01:41:01.958
You should have told us before you
submitted that video, Son-in-law.

01:41:02.208 --> 01:41:03.375
And if I had?

01:41:03.916 --> 01:41:06.375
Would you have protected
this family's honor? Huh?

01:41:06.833 --> 01:41:09.375
You should’ve thought about
my daughter too.

01:41:09.750 --> 01:41:12.458
Do not talk about her!
I have nothing good to say!

01:41:13.708 --> 01:41:15.875
Until yesterday,
this was your family's issue.

01:41:16.208 --> 01:41:17.958
But from today, it’s my issue.

01:41:18.125 --> 01:41:19.958
If we lose this case,
what will people say?

01:41:20.041 --> 01:41:21.250
Will they say Jaabili lost?

01:41:21.375 --> 01:41:24.583
Or that Seetha Ratnam’s daughter lost?
Or that Muthyalaiah’s granddaughter lost?

01:41:24.666 --> 01:41:26.333
They’ll say Mangapathi lost!

01:41:27.541 --> 01:41:29.291
I intentionally revealed the video.

01:41:29.708 --> 01:41:32.458
If we win the case,
we restore our family's honor.

01:41:32.666 --> 01:41:35.916
We can say, "He’s a fraud.
He manipulated our daughter.

01:41:36.166 --> 01:41:39.625
Our daughter is innocent.
She’s an angel."

01:41:39.875 --> 01:41:42.625
We can even say,
"she’s as pure as Goddess Sita!"

01:41:43.708 --> 01:41:46.833
Instead of worrying
about me exposing the video,

01:41:47.458 --> 01:41:50.500
you should be worrying about
why she was with him in that room.

01:41:59.833 --> 01:42:02.500
Hey! What's wrong? Why the sudden visit?

01:42:03.416 --> 01:42:06.041
- I felt like stopping by.
- Did Mohan Rao say something?

01:42:06.125 --> 01:42:07.708
No, Mom. Nothing like that.

01:42:08.083 --> 01:42:10.416
I just thought I’d stay
for a few days, that’s all.

01:42:10.500 --> 01:42:12.791
If you keep questioning me,
I'll leave today.

01:42:13.375 --> 01:42:15.375
What an attitude! Just eat.

01:42:18.250 --> 01:42:19.291
Get me a cup of tea.

01:42:22.583 --> 01:42:23.416
Look.

01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:25.583
Try all you want,
but you can't win this case.

01:42:25.666 --> 01:42:27.625
You don't realize
the power of the POCSO Act.

01:42:27.708 --> 01:42:29.958
Poor boy. He looks young.

01:42:31.250 --> 01:42:32.458
I can tell you one thing.

01:42:32.541 --> 01:42:33.916
Go meet that girl’s family,

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.500
and try to convince them
to withdraw the case.

01:42:36.625 --> 01:42:39.833
If you can’t get them
to compromise and drop the case,

01:42:39.958 --> 01:42:41.625
there’s no chance
of your boy being released.

01:42:41.708 --> 01:42:43.125
With the way things are,

01:42:43.291 --> 01:42:45.375
you don't have any other options.

01:42:49.875 --> 01:42:52.333
Can we go visit them
in the middle of the case?

01:42:53.416 --> 01:42:56.416
You’re not picking a fight with them.
You're trying to reach a compromise.

01:42:56.500 --> 01:42:57.541
It’s fine. You can go.

01:43:14.458 --> 01:43:15.875
Hey!

01:43:15.958 --> 01:43:18.041
What are you doing here? Who let you in?

01:43:18.125 --> 01:43:21.208
Don’t even dream about a compromise,
or the case being withdrawn!

01:43:21.625 --> 01:43:23.916
What, Father-in-law?
Are they relatives now?

01:43:24.250 --> 01:43:27.083
I was wondering if you also
ordered a feast for them.

01:43:27.583 --> 01:43:29.458
What are you staring at? Get inside!

01:43:29.666 --> 01:43:30.625
Get back to work!

01:43:30.708 --> 01:43:32.208
Hey. Get out.

01:43:32.833 --> 01:43:35.958
- Sir…
- Sir! Sir…

01:43:37.166 --> 01:43:39.083
Please save him, sir.

01:43:40.541 --> 01:43:44.708
I'll ensure he never messes with you.

01:43:44.875 --> 01:43:47.833
If he comes near your house again,
I'll break his legs.

01:43:47.916 --> 01:43:49.375
Sir, we'll fall at your feet.

01:43:49.458 --> 01:43:51.625
Please don't ruin his life.

01:43:51.875 --> 01:43:53.750
Show some mercy, please.

01:43:53.875 --> 01:43:57.166
You'll never see us ever again.
We promise you, sir!

01:43:57.250 --> 01:43:59.541
Sir, please let him go.

01:43:59.625 --> 01:44:02.750
- I plead with you, please.
- Sir, I beg you.

01:44:02.916 --> 01:44:06.583
We are mere laborers.

01:44:07.958 --> 01:44:11.875
We can't compete with your status.

01:44:12.291 --> 01:44:13.291
Status!

01:44:13.625 --> 01:44:16.916
You realize your status now,
when you're begging at my feet?

01:44:17.166 --> 01:44:20.166
You should’ve realized it when your son
dared to hold our girl's hand!

01:44:20.250 --> 01:44:23.416
- He made a mistake.
- I’m not dropping the case, come what may!

01:44:23.583 --> 01:44:26.416
- Leave!
- Sir! Please...

01:44:27.291 --> 01:44:28.916
Sir…

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.208

A boy at school

When I told him to watch it,

01:46:02.375 --> 01:46:06.125
he said, "You're okay with your brother
taking a girl into a room

01:46:06.500 --> 01:46:09.250

01:46:10.250 --> 01:46:13.708

Will you get him released
and get your daughter married to him?

01:47:28.916 --> 01:47:29.958
Sympathy is acceptable.

01:47:30.666 --> 01:47:32.750
But you also need to know who deserves it.

01:47:41.041 --> 01:47:42.708
Please give me a kilo of wheat flour.

01:47:42.791 --> 01:47:44.583
Is your boy Chandu still in jail?

01:47:44.666 --> 01:47:46.166
He is not imprisoned. He is in remand.

01:47:46.250 --> 01:47:48.958
He'll be in remand
until the court decides he's guilty.

01:47:49.125 --> 01:47:51.000
He is remanded in jail, is he not?

01:47:54.416 --> 01:47:56.166
- Hello?
- Hello, Mr. Mohan Rao?

01:47:56.833 --> 01:47:58.375
Greetings, sir.

01:47:58.750 --> 01:48:01.333
- What's the matter, Mr. Murthy?
- Nothing, sir.

01:48:01.500 --> 01:48:05.208
You sent your junior to Vizag
for a case recently, didn’t you?

01:48:06.166 --> 01:48:08.333
Please tell us
if there's something like that again.

01:48:08.500 --> 01:48:11.208
- We are in Vizag, right?
- My junior?

01:48:11.291 --> 01:48:13.125
Which case is he handling in Vizag?

01:48:21.458 --> 01:48:23.625
Okay, Mr. Murthy. Thank you.

01:48:24.041 --> 01:48:27.333
Sir! If there are any cases in Vizag,
give them to me.

01:48:27.666 --> 01:48:28.625
Sure.

01:48:56.291 --> 01:48:57.375
What's wrong, Teja?

01:48:57.958 --> 01:48:59.458
Why didn't you come to the office?

01:49:00.625 --> 01:49:02.000
Why do you seem so dull?

01:49:03.041 --> 01:49:04.250
It's all right, tell me.

01:49:05.041 --> 01:49:06.166
I know everything.

01:49:07.958 --> 01:49:09.458
Tell me what's bothering you.

01:49:09.666 --> 01:49:11.666
I tricked you and took over the case, sir.

01:49:13.125 --> 01:49:14.666
And, I got tricked over there.

01:49:14.958 --> 01:49:16.500
What's your problem now?

01:49:17.875 --> 01:49:20.041
That you fooled me,
or that you got fooled?

01:49:20.541 --> 01:49:22.125
I’m unfit to be a lawyer, sir.

01:49:23.083 --> 01:49:24.958
I'm not right for this job.

01:49:26.666 --> 01:49:28.333
This is your problem, Teja.

01:49:29.250 --> 01:49:30.708
You make instant decisions.

01:49:31.416 --> 01:49:34.041
You take quick decisions
without diving deeper into the problem.

01:49:34.125 --> 01:49:35.916
Just because that one case
turned out like that,

01:49:36.458 --> 01:49:39.791
you got heartbroken and came home
saying you're unfit for the job.

01:49:40.333 --> 01:49:43.083
It’s one of the reasons
I never assigned any cases to you.

01:49:46.166 --> 01:49:49.041
Let's take that 304A case.

01:49:51.250 --> 01:49:55.833
I got blasted by people when I defended
the driver in that accident case.

01:49:57.416 --> 01:50:02.458
Everyone kept blaming the driver
for killing a person,

01:50:03.416 --> 01:50:06.583
but why did no one question
why the victim was even there

01:50:08.708 --> 01:50:10.666
at that time, Teja?

01:50:12.916 --> 01:50:13.916
Yes.

01:50:15.291 --> 01:50:16.958
That wasn't an accident, Teja.

01:50:17.625 --> 01:50:18.708
It was a suicide.

01:50:20.291 --> 01:50:22.583
If we had proven to the court
that it was a suicide,

01:50:22.666 --> 01:50:25.250
his family wouldn’t have been eligible
for third-party insurance.

01:50:25.333 --> 01:50:27.583
The driver who purchased
that truck on a loan

01:50:27.666 --> 01:50:29.541
couldn’t afford to pay any compensation.

01:50:30.541 --> 01:50:34.000
That’s why I had to take the case to court
without reaching a settlement.

01:50:35.458 --> 01:50:39.500
When I found out you had already guessed
the questions I asked in that case,

01:50:39.875 --> 01:50:40.958
I felt proud.

01:50:42.583 --> 01:50:44.250
You're intelligent, Teja.

01:50:46.041 --> 01:50:48.875
It's dangerous for intelligent people
to make quick decisions.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:53.125
This is exactly what happened
when I quizzed you on the trolley problem.

01:50:53.583 --> 01:50:57.416
You kept altering your answers
as I kept presenting new reasons.

01:50:57.875 --> 01:51:01.500
You talked about killing
either the one person or the other five.

01:51:02.416 --> 01:51:06.833
But you never questioned
why that one guy or those five men

01:51:06.916 --> 01:51:10.000
were even at the railway track.

01:51:10.708 --> 01:51:13.291
I wasn’t looking for an answer, Teja.

01:51:14.666 --> 01:51:15.833
I was expecting a question.

01:51:17.125 --> 01:51:19.250
The black coat is always
about questioning.

01:51:20.583 --> 01:51:24.541
In the legal profession,
before determining right and wrong,

01:51:24.625 --> 01:51:27.541
we must first understand
why we are in a situation

01:51:28.041 --> 01:51:29.583
that requires such a decision.

01:51:30.291 --> 01:51:32.291
Not with these instant decisions.

01:51:35.666 --> 01:51:37.291
Let bygones be bygones.

01:51:39.375 --> 01:51:40.875
Don't think about it too much.

01:51:40.958 --> 01:51:42.500
- Get back to work!
- Okay, sir.

01:51:46.833 --> 01:51:48.208
- See you.
- Yeah, see you.

01:52:38.916 --> 01:52:39.875
Greetings, sir.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:42.916
Sir.

01:52:47.166 --> 01:52:48.166
Proceed.

01:52:48.500 --> 01:52:51.208
Your Honor,
the charge sheet has been rewritten

01:52:51.458 --> 01:52:53.083
and the sections have been altered.

01:52:53.166 --> 01:52:54.666
The newly added sections are

01:52:54.875 --> 01:52:58.458
IPC Section 376 subsection 2,

01:52:58.708 --> 01:53:00.250
rape of a girl,

01:53:01.583 --> 01:53:04.583
and Section 6 of POCSO Act

01:53:04.833 --> 01:53:06.291
as the girl is a minor.

01:53:07.500 --> 01:53:08.416
Defense?

01:53:09.083 --> 01:53:11.541
My Lord, I plead for an adjournment

01:53:11.625 --> 01:53:14.958
and I also request the Honorable Court
to recall all the witnesses.

01:53:19.666 --> 01:53:20.750
21/08.

01:53:21.333 --> 01:53:22.458
Thank you, My Lord.

01:53:47.583 --> 01:53:49.291
My Lord, page number eight.

01:53:50.666 --> 01:53:52.291
Tell me, CI Ramesh Reddy.

01:53:52.375 --> 01:53:54.416
- You filed this charge sheet, right?
- Yes.

01:53:54.500 --> 01:53:59.333
It has IPC section 376,
subsection 2 for the rape of a girl

01:53:59.416 --> 01:54:01.541
and section 6 of the POCSO Act.

01:54:01.666 --> 01:54:05.000
Why did you file these charges
against the accused?

01:54:05.166 --> 01:54:06.875
The accused had sex with a minor.

01:54:06.958 --> 01:54:08.833
According to the Indian Penal Code,

01:54:08.916 --> 01:54:11.958
sex with a minor girl
is considered as rape.

01:54:12.625 --> 01:54:14.500
That's why we filed a case against him.

01:54:15.375 --> 01:54:17.458
How did you conclude that they had sex?

01:54:17.541 --> 01:54:20.333
What do you mean?
Everybody saw the video footage, right?

01:54:20.416 --> 01:54:21.916
What is in that footage?

01:54:22.083 --> 01:54:24.416
The girl and the boy go into a room,

01:54:24.500 --> 01:54:26.958
close the door,
and come out after 16 minutes.

01:54:27.041 --> 01:54:30.500
So, are you implying that he had sex
with her in those 16 minutes?

01:54:30.583 --> 01:54:32.625
- Yes!
- How did that happen?

01:54:32.708 --> 01:54:34.958
- What do you mean?
- I mean…

01:54:35.041 --> 01:54:38.166
Who initiated it?
What happened after that?

01:54:38.250 --> 01:54:41.791
Can you explain to the court
how the process unfolded after that?

01:54:41.875 --> 01:54:43.375
How would I know all that?

01:54:43.666 --> 01:54:46.375
- I was not in that room, was I?
- So, who saw it then?

01:54:47.208 --> 01:54:48.125
Nobody saw it.

01:54:48.208 --> 01:54:51.500
If no one saw it, how can you say
that they had sex inside?

01:54:51.583 --> 01:54:54.166
On what basis did you file
a rape charge against him?

01:54:54.250 --> 01:54:58.583
When a boy takes a girl to a room,
his intentions are obvious.

01:54:58.666 --> 01:55:01.041
Everybody knows that!
Even a child could tell you.

01:55:01.125 --> 01:55:03.833
Sir, your assumptions
or general perceptions don't matter.

01:55:03.916 --> 01:55:05.166
The court requires evidence.

01:55:05.250 --> 01:55:08.000
We need to know exactly what took place
in that room that night.

01:55:08.083 --> 01:55:10.625
Even if a child witnessed it,
bring them here to testify.

01:55:12.333 --> 01:55:14.125
My Lord, as you've heard,

01:55:14.208 --> 01:55:19.041
CI Ramesh Reddy is speaking about
a generalized public perception.

01:55:19.208 --> 01:55:24.958
We all function within an assumed reality
or a widely accepted belief

01:55:25.041 --> 01:55:28.416
about what happens when a boy
and a girl go into a room together.

01:55:28.500 --> 01:55:30.208
It may not be wrong, My Lord.

01:55:30.291 --> 01:55:32.750
But, it might not always be
right either, Your Honor.

01:55:33.958 --> 01:55:38.041
Even the statement "90 out of 100
people may have done it"

01:55:38.125 --> 01:55:41.291
acknowledges that there is a possibility
that ten may not have.

01:55:41.375 --> 01:55:42.750
Especially in this case,

01:55:43.166 --> 01:55:47.041
whether the accused had sex
with the victim that night

01:55:47.291 --> 01:55:48.625
remains mere speculation.

01:55:48.708 --> 01:55:52.041
And we can't draw conclusions
based on speculations.

01:55:52.125 --> 01:55:55.208
If we had received the information
within 48 hours of the incident,

01:55:55.291 --> 01:55:57.458
we would have had time
to conduct the necessary tests.

01:55:57.541 --> 01:56:00.250
However, since we learned about
the incident several days later,

01:56:00.333 --> 01:56:01.625
we couldn't conduct any tests.

01:56:01.708 --> 01:56:03.333
- So…
- You confirmed it yourselves?

01:56:11.333 --> 01:56:13.750
Mrs. Seetha Ratnam,
after watching the video,

01:56:14.125 --> 01:56:16.708
what did you ask your daughter,
and how did she respond?

01:56:20.125 --> 01:56:23.041
Do you mean to say she didn’t tell you,
or that you never asked her?

01:56:29.041 --> 01:56:30.916
- I didn't ask.
- What?

01:56:31.875 --> 01:56:32.833
I didn't ask.

01:56:33.625 --> 01:56:36.041
- You didn't question your daughter?
- No.

01:56:38.875 --> 01:56:39.791
My Lord!

01:56:40.125 --> 01:56:41.708
Even after seeing the video,

01:56:41.791 --> 01:56:44.750
no one questioned the victim Jaabili.

01:56:45.291 --> 01:56:48.875
People jumped to conclusions
just by watching the video.

01:56:49.666 --> 01:56:51.000
I object, Your Honor.

01:56:52.958 --> 01:56:55.166
Even if we ask her,
what could she possibly say?

01:56:55.666 --> 01:56:57.041
She's mentally disturbed!

01:56:57.125 --> 01:56:58.916
So, her answers will not be reliable.

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:02.583
My Lord, I will discuss the issue
of her mental illness later.

01:57:03.958 --> 01:57:07.666
Only two people know
what happened that night.

01:57:07.750 --> 01:57:10.958
The accused, Chandrasekhar,
and the victim, Jaabili.

01:57:12.166 --> 01:57:14.000
We never questioned Jaabili.

01:57:14.458 --> 01:57:16.333
Let's at least ask Chandrasekhar.

01:57:16.416 --> 01:57:18.208
I request the Honorable Court

01:57:18.291 --> 01:57:21.666
to kindly grant permission
for in-camera proceedings

01:57:21.750 --> 01:57:24.750
to record the statement
of the accused, Chandrasekhar.

01:57:31.583 --> 01:57:35.208
This court is ordering everyone
in this court hall to leave this place

01:57:35.666 --> 01:57:40.458
except the accused, the defense lawyer,
the prosecutor, and the stenographer.

01:57:40.875 --> 01:57:43.416
The rest may leave
until you're called inside.

01:57:43.541 --> 01:57:47.291
In-camera proceedings!
In-camera proceedings!

01:57:47.375 --> 01:57:48.375
Thank you, My Lord.

01:58:16.625 --> 01:58:18.625
Chandrasekhar, tell the judge

01:58:19.208 --> 01:58:21.500
what happened that night in the room

01:58:22.708 --> 01:58:24.000
when you were with Jaabili.

01:59:15.791 --> 01:59:19.458
Since Chandrasekhar's arrest until now,

01:59:19.666 --> 01:59:24.333
neither he nor his friends or family
have met Jaabili, the victim.

01:59:24.541 --> 01:59:27.291
Therefore, the victim, Jaabili,
has had no opportunity

01:59:27.458 --> 01:59:29.666
to know whatever
the accused has just stated.

01:59:29.750 --> 01:59:33.291
We have only one option
to verify his version of events.

01:59:33.833 --> 01:59:34.833
That is Jaabili.

01:59:34.916 --> 01:59:36.916
She won’t appear in court because…

01:59:37.625 --> 01:59:41.958
she’s mentally disturbed,
as the prosecution claims.

01:59:42.750 --> 01:59:45.375
Hence, I request the Honorable Court
to call upon

01:59:45.916 --> 01:59:47.291
Doctor Prabhakar.

01:59:48.708 --> 01:59:51.666
Doctor Prabhakar,
can you explain what happened to Jaabili?

01:59:52.333 --> 01:59:54.458
It is called bipolar disorder.

01:59:54.625 --> 01:59:56.750
Bipolar disorder? What is that, sir?

01:59:56.833 --> 02:00:00.208
Can you please explain it to me
and to the people in this courtroom?

02:00:00.291 --> 02:00:02.583
See. It's a very abnormal behavior.

02:00:03.833 --> 02:00:06.708
Just by looking at her, it's clear
that something is wrong with her.

02:00:06.791 --> 02:00:08.583
Oh! Something is wrong with her?

02:00:08.916 --> 02:00:11.583
- So, you're treating her?
- Yes.

02:00:12.083 --> 02:00:14.333
So, have you admitted her
to your hospital?

02:00:14.416 --> 02:00:17.791
No, no. They bring her to me twice a week.

02:00:17.875 --> 02:00:19.500
- Who brings her?
- Her mother.

02:00:19.750 --> 02:00:21.500
Her mother. So…

02:00:21.750 --> 02:00:25.916
How long does it take for you
to examine the victim?

02:00:26.291 --> 02:00:29.750
Yeah, actually… it takes
five to ten minutes.

02:00:29.833 --> 02:00:31.916
If a counseling session is required,

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:33.916
it may take between 20 to 25 minutes.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.375
Oh, so when she comes with her mother,

02:00:36.458 --> 02:00:39.375
you'll just examine her briefly
and send her home?

02:00:39.833 --> 02:00:42.083
Look, it's a government hospital.

02:00:42.916 --> 02:00:45.208
Many people from the neighboring
villages come there.

02:00:45.458 --> 02:00:47.375
We can't examine them immediately.

02:00:47.458 --> 02:00:49.291
- It takes time.
- How long does it take?

02:00:49.958 --> 02:00:52.958
It might take an hour or two…
depending on the rush, right?

02:00:53.083 --> 02:00:56.125
- Okay. Depending on the rush.
- Yeah!

02:01:02.041 --> 02:01:03.250
Do you know him?

02:01:03.333 --> 02:01:05.875
Yes, he is Sambamurthy. My attendant.

02:01:06.333 --> 02:01:07.583
Thank you for confirming.

02:01:15.458 --> 02:01:18.166
My Lord, the man in the video
is Sambamurthy.

02:01:18.250 --> 02:01:21.041
He works at
a government psychiatric hospital.

02:01:21.208 --> 02:01:22.500
To be precise,

02:01:22.791 --> 02:01:25.125
he's an attendant
in Doctor Prabakar's office.

02:01:25.625 --> 02:01:28.041
A lot of people come
to consult the doctor.

02:01:28.125 --> 02:01:32.791
The doctor confirmed
that many people wait for hours.

02:01:32.875 --> 02:01:36.583
Sambamurthy is the one who spends more
time with the patients than the doctor.

02:01:36.666 --> 02:01:37.666
So, obviously,

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:41.250
hoping that Sambamurthy might
recognize the victim, Jaabili,

02:01:41.333 --> 02:01:43.666
we showed him her picture.

02:01:43.750 --> 02:01:46.000
You can see his response
in this video, Your Honor.

02:01:47.291 --> 02:01:50.333
Sir, have you seen this girl before?

02:01:51.333 --> 02:01:54.083
- No, I've never seen her.
- Try to remember, sir.

02:01:54.500 --> 02:01:57.541
Hey, I’ve never seen her.
I would have told you if I knew her.

02:01:57.791 --> 02:02:01.750
My Lord, how can Sambamurthy,
who saw the victim Jaabili twice a week,

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.416
suddenly fail to recognize her?

02:02:05.208 --> 02:02:08.208
- Prosecutor Damu has to tell us.
- He won't recognize her, Your Honor!

02:02:08.333 --> 02:02:09.416
Of course he won't!

02:02:09.750 --> 02:02:13.250
Had he seen the victim Jaabili's photo,
he would have surely recognized her.

02:02:13.333 --> 02:02:15.291
We are looking at her real picture here.

02:02:15.833 --> 02:02:16.791
But…

02:02:16.875 --> 02:02:19.791
How can we be sure that he showed
the same picture to Sambamurthy?

02:02:19.916 --> 02:02:22.916
He could have used a different picture
to confuse Sambamurthy,

02:02:23.041 --> 02:02:24.125
recorded a video,

02:02:24.208 --> 02:02:28.125
and later morphed it to look like Jaabili
through computer graphics.

02:02:28.208 --> 02:02:30.875
Our defense lawyer is quite capable
of showing us a fake video!

02:02:32.458 --> 02:02:33.625
That's all, Your Honor.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
My Lord, the only person
who can confirm

02:02:37.125 --> 02:02:39.958
whether I showed him
the picture of victim Jaabili is...

02:02:40.083 --> 02:02:41.041
Sambamurthy.

02:02:41.875 --> 02:02:43.250
I hereby propose

02:02:43.875 --> 02:02:47.333
attendant Sambamurthy
as a new witness in this case

02:02:47.416 --> 02:02:49.541
and I humbly request the Honorable Court

02:02:49.625 --> 02:02:52.250
to immediately summon him to the court.

02:02:52.416 --> 02:02:56.166
The Court orders the Bheemunipatnam police
to bring in Sambamurthy

02:02:56.250 --> 02:02:58.500
and present him in the court by 2 p.m.

02:02:58.750 --> 02:02:59.666
Thank you, My Lord.

02:03:00.791 --> 02:03:03.125
- Can I leave?
- Wait a second.

02:03:04.500 --> 02:03:06.708
- Can she leave?
- Yes, she can.

02:03:06.958 --> 02:03:07.875
You can leave.

02:03:11.125 --> 02:03:12.708
- Mr. Sambamurthy?
- Sir.

02:03:12.791 --> 02:03:15.000
I showed you this picture
the other day, didn’t I?

02:03:15.541 --> 02:03:16.625
No, sir.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:18.708
Have a closer look.
It was the same picture.

02:03:19.375 --> 02:03:20.208
No, sir.

02:03:21.500 --> 02:03:23.333
You didn't show me this picture.

02:03:23.416 --> 02:03:24.541
It was some other girl.

02:03:24.625 --> 02:03:26.000
I know this girl very well.

02:03:27.291 --> 02:03:28.625
She comes to our hospital often.

02:03:28.708 --> 02:03:30.250
If you had shown me this picture,

02:03:30.333 --> 02:03:32.666
- I’d have recognized her right away.
- There it is, My Lord!

02:03:34.041 --> 02:03:37.333
These are the defense lawyer's
desperate tactics to win the case.

02:03:38.125 --> 02:03:39.208
That's all, Your Honor.

02:03:41.208 --> 02:03:42.291
August 30th.

02:03:44.125 --> 02:03:45.291
Thank you, Your Honor.

02:03:49.541 --> 02:03:50.666
Sir! Mr. Damu!

02:03:51.875 --> 02:03:53.125
The judge is calling you.

02:03:53.333 --> 02:03:55.083
- He's calling me?
- Yes. Come with me.

02:04:00.250 --> 02:04:02.750
We have extended
the defense's cross-examination.

02:04:02.833 --> 02:04:04.708
- Please cooperate.
- Sure, Your Honor.

02:04:08.875 --> 02:04:10.166
- Mr. Sambamurthy.
- Sir.

02:04:10.250 --> 02:04:13.625
Can you identify Jaabili's mom
from these two pictures?

02:04:15.708 --> 02:04:18.333
Doctor, please wait.
I'll call you if necessary.

02:04:19.875 --> 02:04:20.708
Tell me.

02:04:20.791 --> 02:04:22.208
Your doctor says

02:04:22.541 --> 02:04:25.458
that her mother brings her
to the hospital twice a week.

02:04:25.708 --> 02:04:27.250
- Yes, sir.
- So tell me.

02:04:27.458 --> 02:04:29.291
If you can easily recognize Jaabili,

02:04:29.375 --> 02:04:31.916
you should be able to recognize
her mother as well!

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.833
- Yes, sir.
- Tell me who the girl's mother is.

02:04:38.250 --> 02:04:39.375
- It's her, sir.
- This lady?

02:04:39.458 --> 02:04:40.458
She is her mother!

02:04:40.541 --> 02:04:42.208
- This is…
- Yes, her mother!

02:04:42.291 --> 02:04:43.833
- Yeah? Okay.
- Yes, sir.

02:04:48.458 --> 02:04:50.708
Your Honor, the lady in that picture

02:04:50.791 --> 02:04:53.583
is the accused Chandrasekhar's mother.

02:04:56.875 --> 02:04:58.833
Why is Chandu's mother, Nagalakshmi,

02:04:58.916 --> 02:05:02.458
accompanying the victim, Jaabili,
to the hospital twice a week?

02:05:02.541 --> 02:05:04.750
Only the respected prosecutor
can answer this.

02:05:05.333 --> 02:05:06.541
- Sir, sir!
- Yes?

02:05:06.791 --> 02:05:08.625
- I got confused.
- Really?

02:05:09.333 --> 02:05:10.666
That's not the right picture.

02:05:11.458 --> 02:05:14.083
- Then?
- You are holding the right one.

02:05:14.166 --> 02:05:15.916
- The lady in this picture?
- She's her mother!

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:17.250
Yes! She's her mother.

02:05:17.333 --> 02:05:18.750
- You sure?
- Sure, sir.

02:05:24.791 --> 02:05:28.041
My Lord, the lady in the picture
is my mother.

02:05:30.833 --> 02:05:34.208
I don't have Jaabili's mother's picture,
Your Honor.

02:05:36.583 --> 02:05:39.833
I intended to add Sambamurthy
to the case's witness list

02:05:39.916 --> 02:05:41.250
right from the start.

02:05:41.333 --> 02:05:43.750
But I waited until now

02:05:43.833 --> 02:05:47.166
because I was worried
he could be influenced or bribed.

02:05:47.375 --> 02:05:49.000
But today, Your Honor…

02:05:49.583 --> 02:05:51.375
They bribed him right outside the court!

02:05:56.083 --> 02:06:00.208
My Lord, the statement about her mother
taking her to the hospital is a lie.

02:06:00.958 --> 02:06:04.125
The claim that Doctor Prabhakar
is treating her is a lie.

02:06:04.208 --> 02:06:05.916
Mr. Prosecutor's statement

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:09.500
that the girl is mentally ill
is a complete lie!

02:06:10.541 --> 02:06:11.916
I clearly believe

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:16.750
that Jaabili is mentally fit and fine
to depose her statement.

02:06:16.958 --> 02:06:19.208
They have obstructed justice

02:06:19.291 --> 02:06:23.750
by keeping her away from the court
all these days, Your Honor!

02:06:23.958 --> 02:06:25.958
To overcome this obstruction,

02:06:26.833 --> 02:06:29.708
I request the Honorable Court
to bring her forward

02:06:29.833 --> 02:06:32.208
and have her statement recorded,
Your Honor.

02:06:33.208 --> 02:06:36.125
The Court directs
the Bheemunipatnam police

02:06:36.208 --> 02:06:40.291
to ensure that Jaabili, along with
her parents or guardians,

02:06:40.375 --> 02:06:44.625
is presented before the court
at any cost, on the 30th of this month.

02:06:46.875 --> 02:06:48.416
Thank you so much, My Lord.

02:06:56.958 --> 02:06:59.000
Manga, now we have only two options.

02:07:01.166 --> 02:07:05.125
One is to bring her to the court
and get her to speak in our favor.

02:07:06.916 --> 02:07:09.166
No matter what that defense lawyer
has done till now,

02:07:09.250 --> 02:07:12.375
the girl coming to court and giving
a statement against the boy

02:07:12.833 --> 02:07:14.250
will ensure his punishment.

02:07:15.583 --> 02:07:16.708
What's the other option?

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:22.333
Withdrawing the case.

02:07:26.416 --> 02:07:30.083
We'll have to take Jaabili
to court on Friday.

02:07:35.625 --> 02:07:37.291
We tried our best.

02:07:39.666 --> 02:07:41.250
But, it is inevitable.

02:07:43.583 --> 02:07:44.583
Bring her for a day.

02:07:46.333 --> 02:07:47.375
Where is she?

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:49.833
Jaabili.

02:07:50.708 --> 02:07:51.791
Is she in the room?

02:07:52.250 --> 02:07:53.166
Jaabili!

02:07:53.500 --> 02:07:54.416
Jaabili?

02:07:56.875 --> 02:07:57.791
Now…

02:07:58.458 --> 02:08:01.125
You must testify in court
that he misbehaved with you.

02:08:02.083 --> 02:08:04.958
Or we'll lose the case
and our honor will be lost.

02:08:05.291 --> 02:08:06.125
Got it?

02:08:06.208 --> 02:08:09.041
Your family's honor rests in your hands.
You must protect it.

02:08:09.833 --> 02:08:11.750
Think it over. Okay?

02:08:39.916 --> 02:08:40.750
Proceed.

02:08:41.875 --> 02:08:44.541
Your Honor, as per the orders
of the Honorable Court,

02:08:44.625 --> 02:08:47.166
Jaabili must be presented
before the court today.

02:08:48.666 --> 02:08:49.875
But unfortunately…

02:08:51.083 --> 02:08:52.333
Jaabili has gone missing.

02:08:58.708 --> 02:09:02.208
This is the missing complaint
filed in the police station.

02:09:34.916 --> 02:09:37.750
- Jaabili, come on. We're running late.
- I'm coming, Mom.

02:09:40.625 --> 02:09:42.166
The judge is on leave today.

02:09:42.250 --> 02:09:44.791
The court constable told me.
We don't have to go today.

02:09:44.875 --> 02:09:47.583
We can go when they call us
on the next adjournment date.

02:09:53.333 --> 02:09:56.291
The police are investigating
her disappearance, Your Honor.

02:09:56.375 --> 02:09:58.958
Once we find Jaabili,
we can present her to the court.

02:09:59.041 --> 02:10:03.916
So, we request the Court to put
the proceedings of this case on hold.

02:10:04.166 --> 02:10:07.458
The Court orders to speed up
the investigation to find the girl

02:10:07.541 --> 02:10:10.250
and present her in the court
as soon as possible.

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:13.041
Sure, Your Honor!

02:11:00.500 --> 02:11:01.750
- Hello!
- Raju.

02:11:01.833 --> 02:11:04.500
- Do we have the court today?
- Of course we do.

02:11:04.583 --> 02:11:07.291
Actually, I heard the judge
is on leave today.

02:11:07.375 --> 02:11:10.208
You got the wrong information.
The judge is already here.

02:11:35.375 --> 02:11:36.375
My Lord!

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:38.625
The victim, Jaabili, is here.

02:11:39.250 --> 02:11:41.541
And before calling her
into the witness box,

02:11:41.875 --> 02:11:44.541
I would like to cross-examine
one more person, Your Honor.

02:11:44.916 --> 02:11:46.666
- Who's that?
- Mangapathi.

02:11:48.166 --> 02:11:51.375
Mangapathi! Mangapathi! Mangapathi!

02:12:08.416 --> 02:12:10.500
Mr. Mangapathi.
What do you do for a living?

02:12:10.583 --> 02:12:13.041
- I have a rice mill.
- Is that it? Anything else?

02:12:13.125 --> 02:12:15.875
- I'm also involved in politics.
- Anything else?

02:12:16.958 --> 02:12:19.625
Did you go to the police station
on the day the case was filed?

02:12:19.791 --> 02:12:21.791
I was there the whole day.

02:12:22.083 --> 02:12:23.375
The entire day?

02:12:23.458 --> 02:12:25.291
From the time we saw the video
in the morning

02:12:25.375 --> 02:12:27.166
until the FIR was filed in the evening.

02:12:29.083 --> 02:12:30.125
You didn't do anything else?

02:12:30.208 --> 02:12:32.958
How could I work when a girl
from my family is in trouble?

02:12:33.041 --> 02:12:35.291
- We were worried the whole day.
- I mean…

02:12:35.666 --> 02:12:40.041
Did you do something like paying
workers' salaries or helping someone?

02:12:42.833 --> 02:12:43.791
No.

02:12:46.416 --> 02:12:47.416
I don't remember.

02:12:48.125 --> 02:12:50.666
The thing is,
even in that worried situation,

02:12:51.416 --> 02:12:56.416
you used the ATM opposite
the police station

02:12:56.500 --> 02:13:00.375
to withdraw 25,000 rupees each
from your Andhra Bank and SBI accounts.

02:13:00.750 --> 02:13:02.958
Just wondering
what you did with that money.

02:13:04.083 --> 02:13:05.625
How is this case to the relevant--
I mean...

02:13:05.708 --> 02:13:08.458
This is absolutely irrelevant
to the case, Your Honor!

02:13:09.041 --> 02:13:10.041
Mr. Damu!

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:14.083
Him and the people at the police station
know the relevance of this.

02:13:14.416 --> 02:13:16.750
Please be seated.
He'll explain the relevance.

02:13:17.583 --> 02:13:19.000
Go on, Mr. Mangapathi.

02:13:19.250 --> 02:13:20.750
What did you do with the money?

02:13:23.083 --> 02:13:24.958
I know what you want, sir.

02:13:25.041 --> 02:13:28.083
The other day, you showed two photos
and declared they were both false.

02:13:28.708 --> 02:13:31.958
Today, you're talking about ATMs,
banks, withdrawals and statements

02:13:32.208 --> 02:13:33.958
and manipulating the situation.

02:13:34.041 --> 02:13:35.250
What do you want, sir?

02:13:36.708 --> 02:13:39.208
Look, our girl has suffered an injustice.

02:13:39.958 --> 02:13:42.416
We came to court to ask for justice.

02:13:43.458 --> 02:13:45.750
Please help us if you can.

02:13:47.625 --> 02:13:49.166
Okay, Mr. Mangapathi!

02:13:50.583 --> 02:13:53.583
Your girl will get her justice.
You may stand down.

02:13:56.625 --> 02:13:57.500
My Lord,

02:13:57.583 --> 02:14:01.250
now I request the Honorable Court
to conduct in-camera proceedings

02:14:01.375 --> 02:14:04.666
to record the statement
of the victim, Jaabili.

02:14:08.291 --> 02:14:12.666
In-camera proceedings!
In-camera proceedings!

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:19.916
Jaabili.

02:14:20.333 --> 02:14:22.125
On the night of May 4th

02:14:22.500 --> 02:14:25.541
from 10:52 p.m. to 11:08 p.m.,

02:14:25.791 --> 02:14:27.583
which is almost 16 minutes,

02:14:28.416 --> 02:14:32.375
were you inside room number 106
of Sitara Function Hall?

02:14:33.333 --> 02:14:34.166
Yes, sir.

02:14:35.708 --> 02:14:38.708
Was Chandrasekhar with you?

02:14:39.500 --> 02:14:40.500
Yes, sir.

02:14:42.250 --> 02:14:46.916
Please tell the Court
what happened during those 16 minutes.

02:15:37.791 --> 02:15:40.791
The auspicious time to tie the knot
will begin shortly.

02:15:41.166 --> 02:15:43.750
Let's sit here like bride and groom.

02:15:44.083 --> 02:15:46.291
We'll do as the priest says downstairs.

02:15:46.375 --> 02:15:50.125
How's that possible? We don't have
the auspicious thread and other stuff.

02:15:50.583 --> 02:15:52.625
Let's imagine we have all those things.

02:15:53.791 --> 02:15:55.958
We'll do a wedding rehearsal.

02:16:06.083 --> 02:16:07.333
Beat the drums loudly!

02:17:34.875 --> 02:17:36.791
I'm mentally married to you.

02:17:41.916 --> 02:17:42.833
Okay, let's go.

02:17:42.916 --> 02:17:45.125
My folks will worry
if they don't see me.

02:17:45.583 --> 02:17:46.583
Come on. Let's go.

02:18:10.041 --> 02:18:11.958
What happened in the room that day?

02:18:19.875 --> 02:18:21.541
Did anything wrong happen?

02:18:23.875 --> 02:18:25.666
Oh, no!

02:18:48.041 --> 02:18:50.708
My Lord, considering Chandu's statement
during the last hearing,

02:18:50.791 --> 02:18:53.625
and the girl's statement in this hearing

02:18:53.916 --> 02:18:57.291
it is now clearly established
before the Honorable Court

02:18:57.416 --> 02:18:59.750
that this is all that has happened.

02:18:59.916 --> 02:19:02.375
And this is the ultimate truth,
Your Honor.

02:19:02.458 --> 02:19:06.333
And there is no case of rape
of a minor girl, Your Honor.

02:19:08.333 --> 02:19:10.375
Chandu blackmailing her is a lie.

02:19:11.041 --> 02:19:14.416
Him kidnapping Jaabili
and taking her home is a lie.

02:19:14.750 --> 02:19:17.500
It is a lie
that they had sexual intercourse!

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.041
If there's any truth in all of this,

02:19:20.250 --> 02:19:21.916
it is that they are both in love.

02:19:25.250 --> 02:19:27.541
Just because the girl is a minor,

02:19:27.875 --> 02:19:29.958
they fabricated all these charges

02:19:30.041 --> 02:19:32.250
against my client Chandrashekar,
Your Honor.

02:19:32.458 --> 02:19:34.833
This is a gross misuse of the POCSO Act.

02:19:36.041 --> 02:19:39.791
In this whole incident,
Chandu's only crime

02:19:40.083 --> 02:19:43.791
was entering that room when the girl
he loved asked him to.

02:19:45.291 --> 02:19:48.500
He didn't even know
that would lead to such a big case.

02:19:48.583 --> 02:19:50.000
Not just Chandu, Your Honor.

02:19:50.125 --> 02:19:52.583
Most young people pursuing
a college degree today

02:19:52.666 --> 02:19:55.416
are unaware of the consequences
of falling in love

02:19:55.500 --> 02:19:57.791
with a girl who is in 11th or 12th grade.

02:19:58.166 --> 02:20:00.125
No one educates them
in schools or colleges.

02:20:00.208 --> 02:20:02.000
Not even at home or on TV.

02:20:02.250 --> 02:20:06.750
They dismiss law and order as merely
a matter between lawyers and the police.

02:20:07.833 --> 02:20:11.541
What's the point of these laws
when they remain ignorant of them?

02:20:11.625 --> 02:20:13.583
Before punishing someone
for their mistakes,

02:20:13.666 --> 02:20:15.791
shouldn't we tell them
what their mistake was?

02:20:17.541 --> 02:20:20.833
The law must be part of
the education system in this country.

02:20:21.291 --> 02:20:25.000
I think even an uneducated person
must be aware of the laws!

02:20:27.833 --> 02:20:29.833
Your Honour, with your kind permission.

02:20:29.916 --> 02:20:31.875
As per the records of Jaabili,

02:20:32.375 --> 02:20:36.500
as of today, her age is 17 years,
11 months and 10 days.

02:20:36.875 --> 02:20:40.291
My Lord, had this incident happened
after another 20 days,

02:20:40.541 --> 02:20:42.583
there wouldn't even be a case.

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:49.875
What is considered wrong
on the 17th year and 364th day

02:20:50.291 --> 02:20:53.416
will be deemed right on the first day
of the 18th year.

02:20:53.583 --> 02:20:56.041
Your Honor, how can we assume

02:20:56.125 --> 02:20:59.375
that youngsters will act maturely
as soon as they turn eighteen?

02:20:59.458 --> 02:21:02.125
Maturity isn’t something
that can be bought instantly.

02:21:02.291 --> 02:21:04.125
It is a very subjective matter.

02:21:04.791 --> 02:21:09.500
And our case is between
our constitution and our conscience.

02:21:13.583 --> 02:21:17.708
We all know why the POCSO Act
was designed to be so strict.

02:21:18.166 --> 02:21:22.916
Because if a six-year-old girl
is raped by a 40-year-old man,

02:21:23.125 --> 02:21:24.833
he deserves to be punished severely.

02:21:24.958 --> 02:21:26.875
However, applying the same analogy

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:32.000
to a 19-year-old boy
who is in love with a 17-year-old girl…

02:21:32.916 --> 02:21:35.541
We might have to rethink our approach,
Your Honor.

02:21:36.500 --> 02:21:39.000
Someone in our country
who fell in love at 16

02:21:39.125 --> 02:21:40.750
reached heights later, Your Honor.

02:21:41.458 --> 02:21:43.416
If the POCSO Act had existed back then,

02:21:44.083 --> 02:21:46.333
history would have missed
some notable names.

02:21:46.625 --> 02:21:51.750
Even in this case, this girl called
Chandrasekhar to the room out of love.

02:21:51.833 --> 02:21:54.250
They just playfully
enacted the wedding rituals.

02:21:54.333 --> 02:21:57.375
And it's clear that she was fully aware of
what she was doing.

02:21:57.458 --> 02:22:00.000
Without knowing what actually
happened in the room

02:22:00.083 --> 02:22:02.083
and assuming
their imagination as the truth,

02:22:02.166 --> 02:22:05.333
they filed a POCSO case
against my client, Your Honor.

02:22:06.125 --> 02:22:10.000
Because of people like Mangapathi
who misuse the law,

02:22:10.083 --> 02:22:12.708
innocent lives like Chandrashekar’s
are being ruined.

02:22:14.458 --> 02:22:18.791
This is all Mangapathi's personal vendetta
against a watchman’s son

02:22:18.875 --> 02:22:22.458
for loving a girl
from his household, My Lord.

02:22:23.166 --> 02:22:26.166
On May 9th, he withdrew money
from the ATM

02:22:26.291 --> 02:22:28.458
and gave it to the CI, Your Honor.

02:22:28.541 --> 02:22:34.041
That's how he bribed the police,
lawyers, doctors, and even the witnesses!

02:22:34.125 --> 02:22:36.916
He twisted justice by purchasing
both truth and lies, Your Honor!

02:22:38.625 --> 02:22:40.875
And what’s the total amount of money
he spent?

02:22:40.958 --> 02:22:43.625
Around two lakh rupees,
including legal fees.

02:22:43.708 --> 02:22:47.250
A 19-year-old boy was almost
condemned to 14 years in prison.

02:22:49.208 --> 02:22:51.791
And the torture inflicted
on him and his family!

02:22:55.125 --> 02:22:56.583
Two lakh rupees, Your Honor.

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:58.083
Two lakhs!

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:06.083
I…

02:23:07.958 --> 02:23:09.708
I rest my case, Your Honor.

02:23:30.333 --> 02:23:32.583
Any closing statement
from the prosecution?

02:23:35.541 --> 02:23:36.500
No, Your Honor.

02:23:41.416 --> 02:23:43.000
This court is convinced

02:23:43.333 --> 02:23:45.791
with the defense lawyer's arguments
and believes that…

02:23:46.583 --> 02:23:49.625
the accused, Chandrasekhar,
is not found guilty.

02:23:50.875 --> 02:23:55.333
Considering this case
as a case of love rather than a crime,

02:23:56.416 --> 02:24:00.083
this court declares the accused,
Chandrasekhar, alias Chandu, innocent

02:24:00.250 --> 02:24:02.000
and orders his release.

02:24:09.458 --> 02:24:12.125
This court commends
Lawyer Chaluvadi Surya Teja

02:24:13.416 --> 02:24:17.208
and orders an inquiry against
the Bheemunipatnam Police Station.

02:24:18.583 --> 02:24:19.541
And,

02:24:19.833 --> 02:24:21.500
the Court rebukes Lawyer Damodar,

02:24:21.583 --> 02:24:24.916
and orders an inquiry against Mangapathi
for producing false witnesses

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:29.833
under the Section 8 of
the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.

02:24:30.166 --> 02:24:34.250
The Court orders that Mangapathi be taken
into custody for inquiry.

02:24:34.625 --> 02:24:39.333
He is not to leave town
without permission.

02:25:29.791 --> 02:25:30.750
Sir!

02:26:07.166 --> 02:26:10.208
I thought your honor was my honor.
How dare you turn on me?

02:26:14.416 --> 02:26:19.291
Whether it’s your kids or mine,
be mindful when speaking about girls.

02:26:21.250 --> 02:26:23.125
So you still defend
your daughter's actions.

02:26:24.458 --> 02:26:25.875
You all stand by each other!

02:26:26.166 --> 02:26:27.791
We'll see. We'll meet again!

02:26:54.708 --> 02:26:58.000
{\an8}It's all right, Dad. I got it.
Give it to my little sister.
