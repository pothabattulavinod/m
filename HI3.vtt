00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000


00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000


00:00:52.416 --> 00:00:54.333
Welcome to all the distinguished guests
on the dais.

00:00:54.416 --> 00:00:57.083
To the police officers who show

00:00:57.291 --> 00:01:01.166
immense courage in times of crisis,
risking their own lives to save others,

00:01:01.416 --> 00:01:04.750
the most prestigious honor
given by the central government

00:01:04.833 --> 00:01:06.166
is the Bose Bravery Award.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.083
{\an8}In the past, only one police officer
from the Telugu states received this award

00:01:10.208 --> 00:01:11.583
in 1987.

00:01:11.916 --> 00:01:16.333
After all these years, ACP Dhanya
receiving this award from the government

00:01:16.416 --> 00:01:17.458
is truly a moment of pride!

00:01:17.541 --> 00:01:20.208
Standing ovation for Officer Dhanya,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:01:20.791 --> 00:01:24.083
In the same department where
dedicated officers like ACP Dhanya serve,

00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:27.583
{\an8}it's truly unfortunate that
criminals like Arjun Sarkaar exist.

00:01:27.708 --> 00:01:30.541
On the very day Officer Dhanya is being
honored with the Bose Bravery Award,

00:01:30.625 --> 00:01:32.666
Arjun Sarkaar's case
has come up for hearing.

00:01:42.583 --> 00:01:45.375
If the investigating officer
presents strong evidence,

00:01:45.458 --> 00:01:48.750
{\an8}there's a chance the verdict could be
delivered today, reports say.

00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:54.291
A veteran police officer committing
such a crime is beyond comprehension.

00:01:55.041 --> 00:01:56.375
Is SP Arjun Sarkaar just a facade?

00:01:56.458 --> 00:01:58.166
If so, who's the real person
behind the mask?

00:02:15.541 --> 00:02:16.625
{\an8}Good morning, Lordship.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.750
Generally, if a commoner
commits such a heinous crime,

00:02:19.833 --> 00:02:21.000
they get severe punishment.

00:02:21.083 --> 00:02:24.583
Such an act is completely
unacceptable for a police officer.

00:02:25.041 --> 00:02:26.208
We have a request, Lordship.

00:02:26.291 --> 00:02:29.000
We need two more weeks
to gather solid evidence.

00:02:29.125 --> 00:02:32.208
{\an8}There's a security concern
at the present location

00:02:32.291 --> 00:02:34.291
{\an8}where the accused is being
held in custody.

00:02:34.625 --> 00:02:38.375
{\an8}We can conduct the investigation smoothly
if he's transferred to the central prison.

00:02:39.541 --> 00:02:41.291
{\an8}The girl is nine months old, sir.

00:02:43.458 --> 00:02:45.166
What could he possibly do to her?

00:02:50.541 --> 00:02:52.833
{\an8}He's about 5'9" to 5'10" tall.

00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:57.041
{\an8}He has a few strands of white
in his beard.

00:03:00.458 --> 00:03:01.625
{\an8}Light brown complexion.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:19.750
Hey!

00:03:22.458 --> 00:03:24.458
Are you going to kill him or what?

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Let's go.

00:03:36.791 --> 00:03:38.958
Half the people here
are ones you locked up.

00:03:42.916 --> 00:03:44.083
You might need it.

00:03:53.208 --> 00:03:55.791
That's alright.
You're a cop. Right?

00:03:56.541 --> 00:03:57.791
How did you end up here?

00:04:27.458 --> 00:04:28.750
Shall we start?

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.583
Sir…

00:04:44.291 --> 00:04:45.291
-What--
-Hey!

00:04:50.833 --> 00:04:52.708
You're in the queue. Please wait.

00:04:53.416 --> 00:04:56.791
You're in the queue. Please wait.

00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:01.041
This is Rakshitha speaking.
How may I help you?

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.916
-Rakshitha.
-Sir.

00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.041
-Tell me something honestly.
-Sure, sir.

00:05:07.166 --> 00:05:10.166
Does our country really have 5G,
or are we just calling 2G "5G"?

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.416
-What--
-No, Rakshitha,

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.000
if we try to watch a video on YouTube,

00:05:13.083 --> 00:05:15.250
as soon as you reach
the city outskirts, it starts buffering.

00:05:15.333 --> 00:05:17.250
-We regret--
-In that gap, we get four ads.

00:05:17.375 --> 00:05:19.208
Both the ad and the video
need the internet.

00:05:19.291 --> 00:05:21.541
-But the ads play perfectly, somehow.
-What's that sound?

00:05:21.625 --> 00:05:24.958
Here, at the riverbed, I've got someone
hanging upside down, and I'm killing him.

00:05:25.041 --> 00:05:28.000
-Stop kidding, sir.
-Not joking. The phones don't work here.

00:05:28.333 --> 00:05:31.750
Don't tell me to press 3, 6, 9…
we're beyond that now.

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:34.750
People are losing their lives here.

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.208
Life.

00:05:39.583 --> 00:05:41.750
God breathes life into us

00:05:41.833 --> 00:05:44.875
and gives us longevity
in the form of the life force.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.625
One of our main responsibilities as humans

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.875
is to utilize that life well
to do good deeds.

00:05:52.041 --> 00:05:55.958
Those who misuse it
and commit sinful deeds

00:05:56.083 --> 00:05:59.583
will needlessly fall into a pit of sins.

00:06:47.625 --> 00:06:48.625
Come in.

00:06:49.708 --> 00:06:50.708
Come in!

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:55.500
Arjun Sarkaar?

00:06:57.291 --> 00:07:00.208
I've heard a lot about you.
Why are you sitting here so quietly?

00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:01.916
Sir.

00:07:02.583 --> 00:07:03.625
Interesting.

00:07:03.791 --> 00:07:04.833
Yeah, come.

00:07:05.875 --> 00:07:06.791
Everyone!

00:07:07.125 --> 00:07:08.166
Arjun Sarkaar.

00:07:08.458 --> 00:07:11.166
Your new SP.
He's going to take charge starting today.

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:12.083
Sir!

00:07:12.166 --> 00:07:13.750
-Welcome onboard, Sarkaar.
-Sir.

00:07:13.833 --> 00:07:14.666
Yeah.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.541
Sir. May I come in?

00:08:00.666 --> 00:08:04.125
Sir. I am ASP Varsha.
This is Sub-Inspector Diwakar.

00:08:05.583 --> 00:08:07.875
There are a total of 26 members
in the department.

00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.000
You're the only one in the SP rank, sir.

00:08:10.083 --> 00:08:12.208
-Operations are headed by Nageswar--
-Hey!

00:08:14.125 --> 00:08:15.458
Why are you shaking your legs?

00:08:17.083 --> 00:08:19.166
-Don't.
-Sorry, sir.

00:08:21.333 --> 00:08:22.208
It's okay.

00:08:23.666 --> 00:08:24.625
Sir.

00:08:25.291 --> 00:08:26.666
A case, sir. We need to go.

00:08:59.708 --> 00:09:02.041
Sir. Since the murder was committed
on the riverbed,

00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:04.000
there is no trace evidence left, sir.

00:09:05.125 --> 00:09:07.000
They could have been
swept away by the current.

00:09:10.291 --> 00:09:11.291
Smart.

00:09:16.125 --> 00:09:19.166
-Didn't you find any footprints?
-We did, sir. But no use.

00:09:19.291 --> 00:09:20.583
He left his shoe behind.

00:09:21.625 --> 00:09:22.708
Very smart.

00:09:26.583 --> 00:09:28.500
There are vertical lines here, sir.

00:09:29.791 --> 00:09:31.125
He erased the tire marks.

00:09:31.375 --> 00:09:32.250
Sharp.

00:09:36.083 --> 00:09:37.708
Why is everyone just standing still?

00:09:37.791 --> 00:09:40.000
There was life in this body,
but not anymore.

00:09:40.333 --> 00:09:42.416
What's the purpose?
Focus on that.

00:09:44.458 --> 00:09:45.583
Precision cut.

00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.125
-Someone with a medical background.
-How, sir?

00:09:48.916 --> 00:09:50.291
Anyone can cut the neck.

00:09:50.541 --> 00:09:52.875
Look closely,
he's cut the jugular vein exactly.

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:55.333
If the cut is made there
and hung upside down,

00:09:55.416 --> 00:09:57.000
gravity will take care of the rest.

00:09:57.083 --> 00:09:58.208
Profiling.

00:09:58.583 --> 00:10:00.583
He committed the murder effortlessly, sir.

00:10:00.666 --> 00:10:01.750
Lazy fellow.

00:10:03.041 --> 00:10:04.083
Judgmental.

00:10:05.041 --> 00:10:06.541
The incisions on the torso

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:08.708
don't look like knife stabs.

00:10:10.666 --> 00:10:11.708
Forensics.

00:10:11.916 --> 00:10:12.833
Let them.

00:10:13.125 --> 00:10:14.083
We'll see.

00:10:16.583 --> 00:10:19.708
Any items like bottle caps,
tissue papers or cigarette butts…

00:10:19.791 --> 00:10:21.416
We found a cigarette butt, sir.

00:10:28.125 --> 00:10:29.416
It could've been anyone.

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.125
Would the murderer have sat here,
casually smoking a cigarette?

00:10:32.208 --> 00:10:34.666
Would he sit here listening to sermons
until the victim died?

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:36.958
We'll find saliva residue.
Send it for DNA analysis.

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:46.208
What?

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:48.416
Are we supposed to solve this today?

00:10:49.416 --> 00:10:51.333
You think this is a sequel
to the crime movies you watch?

00:10:51.416 --> 00:10:52.458
-Hey!
-Sir.

00:10:52.666 --> 00:10:53.750
Give me the keys.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Sir.

00:11:17.291 --> 00:11:19.000
Why didn't you come home yesterday?

00:11:36.416 --> 00:11:37.541
I'm asking you.

00:11:38.041 --> 00:11:39.375
I was working. What now?

00:11:40.666 --> 00:11:42.916
Look at how he speaks.
Wretched brat!

00:11:43.208 --> 00:11:45.833
Brutal murder on the outskirts of Vizag.

00:11:45.916 --> 00:11:50.000
39-year-old Thati Ramesh
was hung upside down, throat slit…

00:11:50.083 --> 00:11:51.666
leaving the corpse behind.

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:53.750
Look at how people are turning out to be.

00:11:53.833 --> 00:11:56.416
This case is being investigated by...

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.458
When the upbringing is all wrong,
this is how they turn out.

00:12:09.583 --> 00:12:11.750
KEEN TO CARE CHARITY ORGANIZATION
IS A HUGE SCAM

00:12:27.708 --> 00:12:30.541
{\an8}Have there been any symptoms
like anxiety or zoning out lately?

00:12:32.041 --> 00:12:33.041
Sarkaar.

00:12:34.291 --> 00:12:36.250
{\an8}Any symptoms of zoning out?

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:39.375
{\an8}-Not at all.
-Are you taking the tablets I gave you?

00:12:39.458 --> 00:12:40.916
{\an8}Why isn't your BP under control?

00:12:41.708 --> 00:12:43.291
Have you gone blind, you bonehead!

00:12:44.375 --> 00:12:45.291
Very much in control.

00:12:48.708 --> 00:12:49.791
Why are you fu--

00:12:50.875 --> 00:12:52.666
Don't disturb.
I'm with her.

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:54.291
{\an8}I'll call you back.

00:12:55.291 --> 00:12:56.875
{\an8}You're a cop, right?

00:12:57.125 --> 00:12:58.833
-Yeah.
-Your dad told me.

00:12:59.125 --> 00:13:01.500
{\an8}I hope the violence part is under control.

00:13:01.833 --> 00:13:07.208
-Go back! Go back!
-Arjun Sarkaar, go back!

00:13:09.125 --> 00:13:10.000
Yeah.

00:13:10.333 --> 00:13:11.708
Doctor.

00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:15.458
There's a slight pull…
on my left hand sometimes.

00:13:15.541 --> 00:13:17.500
-Any heart related--
-It shouldn't be a problem.

00:13:17.583 --> 00:13:20.041
{\an8}Anyway, I'm changing your prescription.

00:13:20.166 --> 00:13:22.666
{\an8}-I'm shifting you to Aten 25.
-Isn't 50 better?

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:24.708
I checked online.

00:13:28.791 --> 00:13:32.041
Ask your wife to monitor
your food habits and sleep cycle.

00:13:37.333 --> 00:13:38.833
Did I tell you I'm married?

00:13:44.125 --> 00:13:45.000
Sir.

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:47.625
I need a day off, sir.

00:13:49.083 --> 00:13:50.041
What for?

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.125
I need to attend my daughter's
school annual day celebrations.

00:13:53.375 --> 00:13:56.458
My daughter is performing a dance.
She fondly asked me to be there.

00:13:58.833 --> 00:13:59.875
You can't have it.

00:14:01.666 --> 00:14:03.041
Updates about the riverbed murder.

00:14:03.125 --> 00:14:05.625
These are the details we've found
in the forensic analysis so far.

00:14:05.708 --> 00:14:08.041
Gender: Male.
Age: 39 years old.

00:14:08.125 --> 00:14:09.250
A resident of Bheemili.

00:14:09.333 --> 00:14:12.291
Cause of death: Blood loss due to
jugular vein laceration.

00:14:12.375 --> 00:14:15.500
We found DNA traces on the cigarette butt
that was found at the crime scene.

00:14:16.125 --> 00:14:18.000
The DNA sequence belongs to a dog.

00:14:18.541 --> 00:14:20.333
They thought
the dog smoked the cigarette.

00:14:20.875 --> 00:14:23.500
She is saying the dog licked
the cigarette butt.

00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:24.833
Please continue.

00:14:24.916 --> 00:14:27.916
From the autopsy report, we realized
three internal organs were missing.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.416
Hypothalamus,
pituitary and adrenal glands.

00:14:30.666 --> 00:14:32.791
We're not sure
what he's doing with these organs.

00:14:34.458 --> 00:14:36.291
Nothing beyond this at this point, sir.

00:14:36.625 --> 00:14:38.583
-Sarkaar.
-Sir. On it, sir.

00:14:38.666 --> 00:14:39.875
What does "on it" mean?

00:14:40.291 --> 00:14:41.333
Approach ready, sir.

00:14:41.833 --> 00:14:43.833
I'll decide if it's left or right.

00:14:44.208 --> 00:14:46.291
Okay. You may all leave.

00:14:56.583 --> 00:14:57.458
Thank you.

00:15:01.208 --> 00:15:02.625
I went through your profile.

00:15:03.166 --> 00:15:04.583
You seem to follow only boys.

00:15:05.791 --> 00:15:07.541
-What's the purpose?
-What?

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:08.916
Purp…

00:15:09.291 --> 00:15:11.208
Sorry, but I need to use the washroom.

00:15:21.666 --> 00:15:23.541
-Send this file to the office.
-OK, sir.

00:15:27.125 --> 00:15:28.291
Your cleavage…

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:29.583
Tattoo in that spot…

00:15:29.666 --> 00:15:30.500
Do you drink?

00:15:30.875 --> 00:15:31.833
What's the purpose?

00:15:31.916 --> 00:15:33.375
What's the purpose?

00:15:33.458 --> 00:15:34.791
I need to use the washroom.

00:15:34.875 --> 00:15:36.083
I need to go to the washroom.

00:15:37.791 --> 00:15:39.666
-I have to go to the--
-Washroom?

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:43.208
It's a long way if you go to
the washroom first. The exit's this way.

00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:59.041
-Why don't you knock and enter?
-Hey!

00:15:59.416 --> 00:16:02.166
Will you get married
or stay like this watching porn?

00:16:03.541 --> 00:16:05.875
Why not marry one of your colleagues?

00:16:06.416 --> 00:16:07.958
I won't marry anyone
from the department.

00:16:08.625 --> 00:16:10.333
-That's my rule.
-Seriously?

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.375
You'll remain a loner.

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.208
-You'll need a companion.
-Of course!

00:16:14.875 --> 00:16:16.625
Were you there
when I needed your company?

00:16:17.833 --> 00:16:20.416
You left me with that oldie
as if to reform the country.

00:16:21.375 --> 00:16:22.625
Why all this love now?

00:16:25.708 --> 00:16:27.125
Close the door behind you.

00:16:27.375 --> 00:16:28.625
Keep beating it.

00:17:01.791 --> 00:17:02.791
Arjun?

00:17:05.125 --> 00:17:06.583
-And you are?
-Mrudula!

00:17:07.125 --> 00:17:08.875
You're behaving as if you don't know me.

00:17:09.166 --> 00:17:11.166
You asked me to come
meet you at your office.

00:17:12.125 --> 00:17:13.541
Are you sure you have
the right person?

00:17:13.625 --> 00:17:16.416
We chatted on the matrimony site
last night.

00:17:24.791 --> 00:17:26.208
Yes, tell me.

00:17:26.333 --> 00:17:28.458
Did you create my profile
on the matrimony site?

00:17:28.541 --> 00:17:29.875
Yeah! Why?

00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:32.000
Shouldn't you tell me before you go on
with these chats?

00:17:32.083 --> 00:17:33.416
Don't shout.

00:17:34.041 --> 00:17:35.250
Did anyone show up?

00:17:35.333 --> 00:17:37.583
I figured your face
would've scared them off.

00:17:37.708 --> 00:17:38.958
Hello?

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:52.708
That chat with you… wasn't me.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.125
It was my dad.

00:17:55.833 --> 00:17:57.583
He does this to set me up.

00:18:00.375 --> 00:18:02.458
If I'd seen you first,
I'd have chatted with you.

00:18:02.875 --> 00:18:03.958
But it wasn't me.

00:18:05.166 --> 00:18:06.291
What shall we do?

00:18:07.333 --> 00:18:09.750
Nice. I like your honesty.

00:18:10.833 --> 00:18:14.083
If you're okay,
let's meet up for coffee.

00:18:14.625 --> 00:18:17.458
If it works out, fine.
Otherwise, we'll drop it.

00:18:21.458 --> 00:18:24.083
The ladies' washroom is under renovation.
We arranged bio-toilets.

00:18:24.166 --> 00:18:26.333
Ma'am may not need it.
But just tell her.

00:18:30.708 --> 00:18:32.833
So, Arjun Sarkaar…

00:18:34.041 --> 00:18:35.791
You seem to be an honest person.

00:18:36.958 --> 00:18:39.291
You look average but good-looking.

00:18:40.458 --> 00:18:42.125
A good position in society.

00:18:42.916 --> 00:18:45.916
-Why aren't you married yet?
-You mentioned that I'm average.

00:18:46.208 --> 00:18:49.416
No girl would fall for someone like me.
I don't need any girl. Sorry!

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:52.208
But we call ourselves stags
and brazen it out.

00:18:52.916 --> 00:18:56.291
Meanwhile, we hit 30, hair turns grey,
and we wonder if we're late.

00:18:56.583 --> 00:19:00.625
We'll start getting messages on apps,
saying that a soulmate will come along.

00:19:00.708 --> 00:19:02.041
Bloody idiots. Sorry!

00:19:02.125 --> 00:19:05.125
Reading those messages, we soon hit 35.
We lose fitness. Anxiety grows.

00:19:05.208 --> 00:19:08.875
Someone will start saying it's the most
important phase of your career. Sorry!

00:19:09.166 --> 00:19:11.416
By the time we realize that's not true,
we would've hit 40.

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:13.000
We will be off the market.

00:19:13.625 --> 00:19:16.041
We'll be depending on matrimony websites
and dating apps.

00:19:16.208 --> 00:19:17.083
Sorry!

00:19:18.666 --> 00:19:19.750
Don't laugh.

00:19:20.833 --> 00:19:22.125
It's a serious matter.

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.375
You weren't raised by your mom, right?

00:19:30.875 --> 00:19:31.875
How do you know?

00:19:32.125 --> 00:19:36.583
Only a mother can teach you
how to speak and love.

00:19:36.916 --> 00:19:38.875
Otherwise, they'll end up just like you.

00:19:39.791 --> 00:19:41.541
If it's okay with you, I'll teach you.

00:19:53.041 --> 00:19:54.041
Why?

00:19:54.791 --> 00:19:57.416
I don't know. I just feel like doing it.

00:20:00.166 --> 00:20:01.416
What's the purpose?

00:20:02.791 --> 00:20:04.083
Why do you need a purpose?

00:20:09.125 --> 00:20:11.333
-Are you free till sunset?
-I'm free till sunrise.

No!

00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:21.500
Shall we stay here?

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:23.583
No!

00:23:25.666 --> 00:23:26.708
Shall I leave?

00:23:27.416 --> 00:23:28.625
Do you want to?

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:35.291
Why are you confusing me?

00:23:38.583 --> 00:23:39.583
Hey! Dude!

00:23:39.708 --> 00:23:43.875
1 a.m. at night, and a girl beside you,
what's cooking--

00:23:44.833 --> 00:23:46.416
It's Sarkaar!

00:23:54.416 --> 00:23:58.250
He said it's a shortcut.
Didn't expect that it'd lead to Assam.

00:23:59.625 --> 00:24:00.916
I think ma'am…

00:24:01.583 --> 00:24:02.791
did something.

00:24:04.166 --> 00:24:06.416
Carry on, sir. Bye, sir!

00:24:06.666 --> 00:24:09.708
Hello, Mom! Pack the bags.
We are leaving for the railway station.

00:24:15.416 --> 00:24:17.666
1 a.m. at night

00:24:18.041 --> 00:24:19.750
and a girl beside you.

00:24:22.875 --> 00:24:25.208
Does everyone run away
the moment they see you?

00:24:27.791 --> 00:24:29.125
You didn't run away.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.041
I like you.

00:24:34.333 --> 00:24:35.416
But why?

00:24:37.791 --> 00:24:38.875
I like grey!

00:24:41.916 --> 00:24:43.166
In me?

00:24:46.833 --> 00:24:47.916
In your beard.

00:24:57.916 --> 00:24:59.166
Don't be in a hurry.

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:02.666
Let's save it for later.

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:08.375
Later means?

00:25:09.666 --> 00:25:11.083
On an auspicious day.

00:25:24.833 --> 00:25:26.500
You seem to be happy.

00:26:30.791 --> 00:26:32.541
Sir! Sir?

00:26:33.541 --> 00:26:34.916
-Sir--
-Hey!

00:26:38.958 --> 00:26:40.000
Don't move.

00:26:41.666 --> 00:26:43.833
-Oh, it's you.
-Don't do anything stupid.

00:26:45.041 --> 00:26:46.166
Throw away the knife.

00:26:50.541 --> 00:26:51.958
Never take your eyes off.

00:26:54.166 --> 00:26:56.041
Everything is a distraction. Focus!

00:26:59.458 --> 00:27:00.583
Disengage the threat.

00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:12.416
Are you done with your power nap?

00:27:18.333 --> 00:27:19.791
That's a Palomar knot.

00:27:19.958 --> 00:27:21.541
It won't come off easily.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.041
I suspected you on the very first day.

00:27:24.416 --> 00:27:26.208
Are you really a police officer?

00:27:26.541 --> 00:27:29.458
You're killing civilians.
Bloody psychopath!

00:27:29.583 --> 00:27:30.750
I'll report you.

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:33.000
You don't deserve to be a cop!

00:27:43.166 --> 00:27:46.958
Even if you report me and put me
behind bars, these murders won't stop.

00:28:19.416 --> 00:28:20.666
Hands are freezing, sir.

00:28:21.291 --> 00:28:23.458
-Put your gloves on.
-My balls are freezing.

00:28:23.541 --> 00:28:25.083
What should be done about that?

00:28:25.833 --> 00:28:26.666
Sir.

00:28:35.791 --> 00:28:37.375
{\an8}Why is the family allowed here?

00:28:37.666 --> 00:28:39.666
{\an8}-How can they bear seeing it?
-Sorry, sir!

00:29:16.708 --> 00:29:19.791
Footprints and traces have not registered
because of the heavy snow.

00:29:19.875 --> 00:29:22.541
Let's say the footprints vanish
because they're made on snow.

00:29:23.458 --> 00:29:25.333
-What about tire marks?
-Sir?

00:29:27.583 --> 00:29:30.750
The vehicle's weight forms tire marks
on the mud beneath the snow.

00:29:30.833 --> 00:29:32.583
-You're right, sir.
-Melt it.

00:29:33.166 --> 00:29:34.666
-Sir!
-Snow!

00:29:35.708 --> 00:29:37.041
Melt it.

00:29:45.708 --> 00:29:48.041
Probably three to four inches
taller than me.

00:29:49.125 --> 00:29:52.250
Jugular vein laceration,
approximately five centimeters long.

00:29:53.625 --> 00:29:57.583
Incisions on the torso and…
back of the head.

00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:00.041
He did something after killing.

00:30:00.125 --> 00:30:01.625
Ask forensics to look properly.

00:30:03.166 --> 00:30:06.625
Ask them to collect swabs on injuries.
See if there is any trace evidence there.

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:12.500
-Sir!
-Here. Over here.

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:17.791
Eighteen-inch alloy.

00:30:18.666 --> 00:30:19.666
A big vehicle.

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:21.916
Take photos of the tire pattern.

00:30:22.041 --> 00:30:23.125
Tape!

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:25.333
9mm groove.

00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:27.125
A new tire.

00:30:28.125 --> 00:30:29.916
Get a list of tire vendors…
Ravi.

00:30:30.125 --> 00:30:31.666
-Sir!
-New tire.

00:30:32.375 --> 00:30:34.291
Get the list of tire vendors
in the valley.

00:30:34.375 --> 00:30:35.333
Okay, sir!

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:37.916
If he carried the body from here…

00:30:40.125 --> 00:30:41.250
he is physically fit.

00:30:43.166 --> 00:30:46.208
Tell him in Hindi not to fucking aim
the flame thrower at my face.

00:30:51.416 --> 00:30:55.833
Did anyone see a big vehicle
heading to the valley last night?

00:30:55.916 --> 00:30:57.666
-No, we didn't see!
-No?

00:31:04.833 --> 00:31:05.875
Thank you.

00:31:08.458 --> 00:31:09.375
Sir!

00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:12.666
You're like the star of our family, sir.

00:31:12.875 --> 00:31:14.333
My daughter wants to meet you.

00:31:15.583 --> 00:31:17.625
-Name?
-My name is Alaika.

00:31:17.708 --> 00:31:18.833
Alaika!

00:31:19.416 --> 00:31:20.541
Alaika, my…

00:31:20.833 --> 00:31:21.958
grandfather,

00:31:23.083 --> 00:31:25.166
used to tell me something.

00:31:26.333 --> 00:31:27.875
Every police officer

00:31:28.291 --> 00:31:29.208
is a star.

00:31:29.416 --> 00:31:31.000
Your dad is… a star.

00:31:32.041 --> 00:31:33.791
So tell me. Will you become a star?

00:31:36.541 --> 00:31:37.625
This star is for you.

00:31:38.208 --> 00:31:39.375
Thank you.

00:31:42.125 --> 00:31:43.416
Autopsy report.

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:46.375
Injuries on the torso
and the back of the head.

00:31:46.458 --> 00:31:49.208
Sustained after death. Three organs
are missing from the body.

00:31:49.416 --> 00:31:51.750
Hypothalamus, pituitary
and adrenal glands.

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:53.416
Organ trade?

00:31:54.583 --> 00:31:55.416
No.

00:31:56.041 --> 00:31:57.666
This isn't about organ trade, Ravi.

00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:59.708
These are hormone-secreting organs.

00:32:00.041 --> 00:32:01.458
Not suitable for a transplant.

00:32:02.375 --> 00:32:04.708
If he is so brutal as to
display after the killing,

00:32:05.708 --> 00:32:07.000
there's more to it, Ravi.

00:32:08.333 --> 00:32:09.875
We need to get this guy soon.

00:32:21.666 --> 00:32:24.875
Sir, a black Bolero entered
the forest around that time.

00:32:26.083 --> 00:32:28.666
Black Bolero, 18-inch alloy,
a new tire. Right!

00:32:29.583 --> 00:32:33.166
Get me a list of those who recently
changed a black Bolero's tires in town.

00:32:33.458 --> 00:32:34.500
Make it fast.

00:32:50.125 --> 00:32:53.125
We've procured information
from all the tire shops, sir.

00:32:53.416 --> 00:32:56.416
There are three black Boleros in town
which got new tires recently.

00:33:47.125 --> 00:33:48.625
-What's happening?
-Inquiry.

00:33:49.041 --> 00:33:51.541
-Any men in the house?
-There's none.

00:33:51.625 --> 00:33:52.666
What do you do?

00:33:53.458 --> 00:33:55.041
-I'm a hunter.
-Alright.

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:56.333
Hunting?

00:33:58.541 --> 00:33:59.541
The Bolero outside…

00:34:00.416 --> 00:34:02.083
-Yours?
-That's right.

00:34:02.375 --> 00:34:03.875
We have a milk business.

00:34:09.125 --> 00:34:10.291
What's this animal?

00:34:11.208 --> 00:34:12.791
This is a Haput.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.000
What is that?

00:34:15.125 --> 00:34:15.958
What do you mean?

00:34:16.375 --> 00:34:17.250
Meaning.

00:34:18.166 --> 00:34:19.916
-Meaning what?
-Meaning--

00:34:20.375 --> 00:34:21.500
What does Haput mean?

00:34:22.166 --> 00:34:23.916
Alright. Haput means…

00:34:24.916 --> 00:34:25.833
Brown bear.

00:34:26.583 --> 00:34:28.083
Ask them if they supply milk
in Dachigam.

00:34:28.166 --> 00:34:29.583
Do you supply in Dachigam?

00:34:29.791 --> 00:34:31.583
No. Why would we go there?

00:34:46.666 --> 00:34:47.708
That's my son.

00:34:48.375 --> 00:34:49.750
Poor thing. He's not well.

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:55.250
Gun… License…

00:34:56.083 --> 00:34:57.416
License?

00:35:03.708 --> 00:35:04.708
-Open it.
-Sir?

00:35:04.916 --> 00:35:06.458
Break it.
Ask them to open it.

00:35:06.625 --> 00:35:07.791
Break open that door.

00:35:25.833 --> 00:35:27.208
Sir, he's running away!

00:35:27.333 --> 00:35:28.291
Hey! Catch him!

00:35:37.166 --> 00:35:39.666
-Take him to the hospital. Make it fast.
-Pick him up!

00:36:00.208 --> 00:36:01.041
Scoundrel!

00:36:02.416 --> 00:36:03.333
Scoundrel!

00:37:15.833 --> 00:37:17.666
How dare you grab my hair, you rascal?

00:38:21.583 --> 00:38:23.333
Back. Go back.

00:38:26.208 --> 00:38:27.041
Enough.

00:38:27.583 --> 00:38:28.416
Move back.

00:39:13.125 --> 00:39:14.125
He is safe now, sir.

00:39:14.708 --> 00:39:15.625
Everything's fine.

00:39:28.291 --> 00:39:29.791
Yeah, I understand.

00:39:30.166 --> 00:39:31.166
Sarkaar…

00:39:31.916 --> 00:39:34.375
-Ma'am?
-Why so much violence?

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.583
I was just talking to the doctor.

00:39:36.708 --> 00:39:39.125
Five men are in critical condition
in the hospital.

00:39:39.375 --> 00:39:40.666
One of my team's officer

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:42.958
is also in critical condition.

00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:46.916
Being a Hindu police,
you've sent five Muslims to the hospital.

00:39:47.125 --> 00:39:48.458
-Political--
-Hindu police…

00:39:49.125 --> 00:39:50.000
Muslim police…

00:39:50.458 --> 00:39:51.291
No.

00:39:52.208 --> 00:39:53.041
Just police.

00:39:54.875 --> 00:39:55.708
Jai Hind, ma'am.

00:40:02.208 --> 00:40:03.375
Place his hand forward.

00:40:18.916 --> 00:40:20.250
Paramedics on standby.

00:40:26.041 --> 00:40:27.666
Dislocated bone.
Call paramedics.

00:40:29.583 --> 00:40:30.833
Did you commit the murder?

00:40:31.041 --> 00:40:31.958
What?

00:40:32.875 --> 00:40:33.875
These incisions…

00:40:34.208 --> 00:40:35.041
This cut…

00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:36.583
What's this?

00:40:37.583 --> 00:40:38.875
Organs?

00:40:39.250 --> 00:40:40.250
Already out.

00:40:40.708 --> 00:40:41.625
Hey!

00:40:41.916 --> 00:40:42.916
Get up.

00:40:43.666 --> 00:40:44.708
Hey!

00:40:45.458 --> 00:40:47.583
-Put that other hand forward.
-Yes, sir.

00:40:50.125 --> 00:40:53.000
Sir, the cyber department
has managed to unlock his phone.

00:40:59.833 --> 00:41:00.666
Wake him up.

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:06.375
Hey! Get up.

00:41:10.791 --> 00:41:13.666
{\an8}A terrible incident took place
in Arwal district in Bihar today.

00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:15.416
A man was killed brutally.

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:17.541
{\an8}His body was found hanging
from a tree.

00:41:22.041 --> 00:41:24.250
{\an8}No matter how much our team tried,
he wouldn't--

00:41:27.708 --> 00:41:28.833
{\an8}Sir, same method.

00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:30.916
{\an8}Did he commit this murder, too?

00:41:31.083 --> 00:41:32.250
{\an8}It happened in Bihar.

00:41:33.416 --> 00:41:35.875
{\an8}I mean, did he commit a murder there
and come here?

00:41:36.916 --> 00:41:38.083
It happened today.

00:41:39.333 --> 00:41:41.208
Get the details from
the investigating officer in Bihar.

00:41:41.625 --> 00:41:42.583
{\an8}Sure, sir.

00:41:51.458 --> 00:41:53.500
Sir, I spoke to the investigating officer.

00:41:53.666 --> 00:41:56.375
They nabbed the culprit within
an hour of committing the crime.

00:41:56.458 --> 00:41:58.916
The SI refused to provide
the details when I inquired.

00:42:00.916 --> 00:42:04.541
How can two criminals carry out
crimes in exactly the same way?

00:42:06.083 --> 00:42:07.291
We need to go to Bihar.

00:42:07.708 --> 00:42:08.875
Make the arrangements.

00:42:09.125 --> 00:42:10.666
It happened in the Arwal district.

00:42:10.791 --> 00:42:12.125
Notorious for Maoists.

00:42:12.541 --> 00:42:15.541
Police presence in that region
is always backed by paramilitary units.

00:42:15.625 --> 00:42:16.750
It's not safe, sir.

00:42:39.583 --> 00:42:41.958
ARWAL POLICE STATION

00:42:50.125 --> 00:42:52.666
-Sir.
-You weren't cooperating on the phone.

00:42:54.375 --> 00:42:55.291
Why?

00:42:55.958 --> 00:42:57.958
-What was the purpose?
-Sorry, sir. I…

00:42:58.416 --> 00:43:00.541
I was busy. It was a mistake.

00:43:00.666 --> 00:43:02.416
Please come.
He's right here in the cell.

00:43:17.708 --> 00:43:18.583
Sir.

00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:21.916
We got this from his house.

00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:49.000
Sir, a message from NCDB.

00:43:49.083 --> 00:43:51.500
Thirteen murders took place
in a similar pattern across India.

00:43:53.458 --> 00:43:55.291
All are unsolved
and had random victims.

00:43:55.375 --> 00:43:57.375
Also, there wasn't
any geographical connectivity.

00:43:57.541 --> 00:43:59.416
Six such cases were registered abroad.

00:44:17.458 --> 00:44:19.416
That's just the count of reported murders.

00:44:20.166 --> 00:44:22.083
Meaning many more went unreported.

00:44:24.166 --> 00:44:27.125
If all of them are committing
these murders in the same method,

00:44:27.458 --> 00:44:28.958
there's surely a motive.

00:44:31.458 --> 00:44:32.375
Hey, get up.

00:44:34.791 --> 00:44:37.916
What is this? How and why?

00:44:38.875 --> 00:44:40.208
What's happening?

00:44:43.375 --> 00:44:44.375
Hey!

00:45:03.791 --> 00:45:05.583
Have you seen this man before?

00:45:06.791 --> 00:45:07.666
Seen him before?

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.208
What's your connection?

00:45:11.708 --> 00:45:13.458
Mr. Mukesh, we received intel

00:45:13.541 --> 00:45:15.375
that there's going to be
a Maoist attack here.

00:45:15.458 --> 00:45:17.000
-Sure?
-That's right, sir.

00:45:17.708 --> 00:45:19.291
His dad funds the Maoists.

00:45:22.333 --> 00:45:24.791
-What?
-His dad seems to be a Maoist funder.

00:45:24.875 --> 00:45:27.375
We've received intel about
a planned attack on this station.

00:45:27.458 --> 00:45:29.041
We've to leave right now!

00:45:30.208 --> 00:45:32.041
Make arrangements
to transfer him to Srinagar.

00:45:32.125 --> 00:45:33.083
Transfer?

00:45:33.208 --> 00:45:35.416
You need the magistrate's permission
to transfer him.

00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:36.875
It'll take at least two hours.

00:45:36.958 --> 00:45:38.083
We don't have that much time.

00:45:38.166 --> 00:45:41.083
If something happens to you,
our jobs are at stake.

00:45:41.208 --> 00:45:42.375
We have to move right now.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.333
Is he from the South?

00:45:48.125 --> 00:45:49.333
Hey, Madrasi!

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.333
Paperwork can go fuck itself!

00:46:02.833 --> 00:46:04.250
This could land us in trouble.

00:46:04.333 --> 00:46:08.416
I'll take it if Andhra and Telangana guys
disown me. But if he calls me a Madrasi…

00:46:10.708 --> 00:46:12.041
What else did he say?

00:46:12.208 --> 00:46:13.291
South…

00:46:14.958 --> 00:46:16.958
His "South" will hurt him today.

00:46:17.708 --> 00:46:18.625
Sir!

00:46:39.041 --> 00:46:41.000
Alpha team. Incoming fire at vehicles.

00:46:47.583 --> 00:46:49.458
-Cover 3’o clock and 9’o clock.
-Copy that.

00:47:18.958 --> 00:47:19.916
180 block.

00:47:21.458 --> 00:47:23.125
Brake hard on my command, guys.

00:47:24.041 --> 00:47:25.083
Get…

00:47:26.333 --> 00:47:27.333
Set…

00:47:30.666 --> 00:47:31.583
Go.

00:47:39.208 --> 00:47:42.125
Target disengaged.
You can continue to the airstrip. Over.

00:47:42.416 --> 00:47:43.333
Jai Hind!

00:47:47.666 --> 00:47:49.041
Madrasi, he says!

00:48:04.041 --> 00:48:07.375
-Go back! Go back!
-Arjun Sarkaar, go back!

00:48:07.458 --> 00:48:10.708
-Go back! Go back!
-Arjun Sarkaar, go back!

00:48:10.791 --> 00:48:14.083
-Go back! Go back!
-Arjun Sarkaar, go back!

00:48:14.166 --> 00:48:17.541
-Go back! Go back!
-Arjun Sarkaar, go back!

00:48:19.916 --> 00:48:20.875
{\an8}Ma'am!

00:48:22.583 --> 00:48:24.125
I have some news for you, Sarkaar.

00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:27.416
{\an8}Of those five people you thrashed
and sent to the hospital,

00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:29.166
{\an8}two are Azad Kashmir activists.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.083
Rebel leaders of
the Azad Kashmir movement.

00:48:32.291 --> 00:48:33.708
It's now a political problem.

00:48:33.875 --> 00:48:36.458
God forbid, if something happens to
even one of them,

00:48:36.583 --> 00:48:37.833
then the valley will burn.

00:48:38.416 --> 00:48:40.958
The protest happening outside
is just the beginning.

00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:45.541
Two criminals, ma'am.
They are in custody.

00:48:45.875 --> 00:48:47.125
The same type of murders.

00:48:47.291 --> 00:48:48.625
First, those 13 murders…

00:48:49.125 --> 00:48:50.500
There's a connection, ma'am.

00:48:50.958 --> 00:48:52.375
-I'll find out.
-Okay.

00:48:52.958 --> 00:48:54.000
Do it fast.

00:48:55.125 --> 00:48:57.958
Things that are common to both
of them should be on my table.

00:48:58.166 --> 00:48:59.333
-Be on it.
-Okay, sir.

00:49:22.708 --> 00:49:24.958
I've separated everything
that looked suspicious.

00:49:30.625 --> 00:49:32.416
Same guy, multiple identities.

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.083
C…

00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:56.833
T…

00:49:57.583 --> 00:49:58.541
K.

00:50:00.666 --> 00:50:02.000
CTK.

00:50:03.875 --> 00:50:05.208
Have you heard this before?

00:50:07.208 --> 00:50:08.250
No, sir.

00:50:09.166 --> 00:50:10.625
Why do I feel like I have?

00:50:11.625 --> 00:50:13.083
That, too, in the same case.

00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:18.750
Ravi. I want to see the files and photos
of this case again.

00:50:18.875 --> 00:50:20.583
-Okay, sir.
-Chain of custody.

00:50:21.291 --> 00:50:24.666
-Down with the HIT!
-Down with the HIT!

00:50:26.375 --> 00:50:29.416
-Down with the HIT!
-Down with the HIT!

00:50:37.916 --> 00:50:41.541
We want justice! We want justice!

00:50:41.625 --> 00:50:43.750
We want justice! We want justice!

00:50:50.416 --> 00:50:52.875
We want justice! We want justice!

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:54.458
Barricades open!

00:51:08.458 --> 00:51:09.666
Who lit this?

00:51:10.125 --> 00:51:11.958
This… Who did it?

00:51:37.541 --> 00:51:38.833
Uniform!

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:42.333
Respect.

00:51:57.083 --> 00:51:58.416
CTK is the connection.

00:51:58.750 --> 00:52:02.291
The removal of the organs, the tattoos,
inscriptions on the murder weapons,

00:52:02.375 --> 00:52:04.875
all seem to point to some religious cult.

00:52:05.541 --> 00:52:09.166
In the 70s in the US, serial killings
were committed under the name BTK.

00:52:09.541 --> 00:52:10.875
This sounds similar to that.

00:52:11.875 --> 00:52:12.916
Do one thing.

00:52:13.916 --> 00:52:15.416
Put them both in the same room.

00:52:16.166 --> 00:52:17.958
-Let's trigger them and see.
-Okay, sir.

00:52:20.041 --> 00:52:22.125
Vijay Deenanath Chauhan.

00:52:22.833 --> 00:52:23.708
Full name.

00:52:25.166 --> 00:52:26.625
I have a mother!

00:52:27.125 --> 00:52:28.875
You will have to double the tax!

00:52:30.708 --> 00:52:32.916
My Hindi is half-half.

00:52:33.416 --> 00:52:34.708
But Hindi film knowledge,

00:52:35.416 --> 00:52:36.750
hundred percent.

00:52:37.833 --> 00:52:39.583
You must have heard the name.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.666
C… T… K.

00:52:45.583 --> 00:52:46.916
You know. You know.

00:52:48.333 --> 00:52:49.375
You know everything.

00:52:50.791 --> 00:52:53.875
This hanging, the recording,
and the procedure…

00:52:55.291 --> 00:52:56.208
You did it right.

00:52:57.333 --> 00:52:58.750
His is all half done.

00:52:59.416 --> 00:53:00.958
How do you say it in Hindi?

00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:02.583
It's a fuckup.

00:53:02.666 --> 00:53:03.916
You did a terrible job.

00:53:04.125 --> 00:53:05.708
-What do you mean?
-Just shut up.

00:53:06.208 --> 00:53:08.708
-Don't say a word.
-Don't say a word!

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:10.041
Why should I stay quiet?

00:53:10.125 --> 00:53:12.000
-Hey! Rules.
-Rules!

00:53:12.083 --> 00:53:13.458
Rules.

00:53:13.958 --> 00:53:16.000
What rules? I followed everything.

00:53:16.125 --> 00:53:18.500
What do I know? He's saying that
you did something bad.

00:53:18.583 --> 00:53:21.083
-You did something wrong.
-I didn't do anything wrong.

00:53:21.291 --> 00:53:22.458
What did he do wrong?

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.166
This cut is in the wrong place.

00:53:26.125 --> 00:53:27.291
No. It's perfectly fine.

00:53:27.375 --> 00:53:30.208
We got the placement and size
of the cut from the website--

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.583
Oh, Samba!

00:53:36.833 --> 00:53:38.750
CTK is a website.

00:53:39.958 --> 00:53:41.250
Nothing on the internet, sir.

00:53:42.333 --> 00:53:43.500
CTK.

00:53:43.625 --> 00:53:47.291
This is not a usual website that can be
accessed through home computers.

00:53:47.875 --> 00:53:51.291
-It's a dark website.
-You mean it's a secret website.

00:53:52.375 --> 00:53:56.041
Correct. Regular websites
like Google, YouTube, etc.

00:53:56.458 --> 00:53:58.416
are closely monitored by
our cybersecurity team.

00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:00.333
Such websites can be tracked easily.

00:54:00.458 --> 00:54:03.791
There are a few websites that
are unknown and are run in the dark.

00:54:05.250 --> 00:54:06.291
Dark web.

00:54:09.375 --> 00:54:11.333
These secret websites

00:54:11.583 --> 00:54:14.708
can't be tracked even by cyber teams.

00:54:15.875 --> 00:54:19.958
That is why guns, drugs, high-level
prostitution, and human trafficking,

00:54:20.125 --> 00:54:23.291
are run on these secret websites.

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.041
And new-age cyber criminals
are earning crores of rupees from it.

00:54:27.166 --> 00:54:28.750
Basically, this dark web

00:54:28.875 --> 00:54:30.208
is like a shield to them.

00:54:30.333 --> 00:54:34.166
Criminals are hiding behind this mask.

00:54:34.458 --> 00:54:36.125
The two criminals we nabbed

00:54:36.416 --> 00:54:38.625
are using a secret website
on the dark web.

00:54:38.791 --> 00:54:42.166
CTK. Capture, Torture, Kill.

00:54:48.875 --> 00:54:50.125
Sir. What's this?

00:54:50.291 --> 00:54:52.666
Why are the murder videos
shared on the website?

00:54:52.875 --> 00:54:55.500
Psychopaths and serial killers
generally won't expose

00:54:55.583 --> 00:54:57.125
their twisted mindsets anywhere.

00:54:57.208 --> 00:54:58.291
For obvious reasons.

00:54:58.541 --> 00:55:00.250
So, knowing they won't be caught,

00:55:00.333 --> 00:55:04.791
they share those murder and torture videos
with one another on the dark web.

00:55:04.875 --> 00:55:07.791
People with the same mentality
use this website to connect.

00:55:08.083 --> 00:55:09.375
Simply put,

00:55:10.375 --> 00:55:12.333
a social media site for serial killers.

00:55:12.833 --> 00:55:14.208
This CTK website.

00:55:14.291 --> 00:55:16.250
There's a demand for everything here,

00:55:16.333 --> 00:55:18.250
from child abuse videos to
murder videos.

00:55:18.333 --> 00:55:20.583
Why are they murdering everyone
in the same pattern?

00:55:20.666 --> 00:55:22.625
The rules set by the website's owner.

00:55:23.666 --> 00:55:25.541
To become a member of that group,

00:55:25.666 --> 00:55:28.500
you have to upload at least
two murder videos like this.

00:55:29.166 --> 00:55:30.291
To win their trust.

00:55:30.916 --> 00:55:32.583
How the murders should be done,

00:55:32.666 --> 00:55:34.083
how to remove the organs,

00:55:34.291 --> 00:55:36.125
how to preserve the organs,

00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:38.833
and where to send them,
they will tell you everything.

00:55:38.958 --> 00:55:42.833
After two murder videos are approved,
they'll be added to the group.

00:55:44.250 --> 00:55:45.916
The strange thing here is that,

00:55:47.875 --> 00:55:52.375
members in this group
meet somewhere once a year.

00:55:56.375 --> 00:55:58.208
We're on to something huge, Ravi.

00:55:58.625 --> 00:56:00.208
I want to know who's behind this website.

00:56:00.291 --> 00:56:01.583
Why are they removing the organs?

00:56:01.666 --> 00:56:04.083
Where are they meeting?
And why are they meeting?

00:56:05.083 --> 00:56:06.833
Inform the cyber team immediately.

00:56:06.916 --> 00:56:09.541
Ask them to find this website's
server location.

00:56:09.833 --> 00:56:11.750
-Be on it.
-Sure, sir.

00:56:12.208 --> 00:56:15.375
-Down with the HIT!
-Down with the HIT!

00:56:15.458 --> 00:56:18.708
-Down with the HIT!
-Down with the HIT!

00:56:18.791 --> 00:56:21.166
-Go back! Go back!
-Arjun Sarkaar, go back!

00:56:21.416 --> 00:56:22.333
Sir.

00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:25.375
The cyber team tried to find
the server location.

00:56:25.625 --> 00:56:27.666
The website is run through
multiple servers.

00:56:27.750 --> 00:56:29.125
From 385 places.

00:56:29.583 --> 00:56:30.958
We can't do anything, sir.

00:56:31.833 --> 00:56:36.166
We want justice! We want justice!

00:57:01.958 --> 00:57:04.250
-Sarkaar. Sarkaar!
-Two minutes.

00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:05.500
Two minutes, ma'am.

00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:07.250
Got a call from the hospital.

00:57:07.666 --> 00:57:09.166
One of those guys has died.

00:57:11.416 --> 00:57:12.833
You need to leave right now.

00:57:17.541 --> 00:57:18.625
Two minutes, ma'am.

00:57:18.916 --> 00:57:21.500
You're not getting it.
Listen to me!

00:57:21.583 --> 00:57:24.125
If the protestors get
wind of this information…

00:57:24.583 --> 00:57:26.125
It's not safe here, Sarkaar.

00:57:26.250 --> 00:57:28.250
Listen to me.
You have to get out of here.

00:57:28.375 --> 00:57:31.166
Sarkaar, listen to me.
Sarkaar!

00:58:01.583 --> 00:58:04.250
After one guy died in the hospital
and another in the lockup

00:58:04.333 --> 00:58:05.833
it caused a political problem.

00:58:06.625 --> 00:58:08.833
I got transferred to Vizag
from HIT, Srinagar.

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.333
To find out where they meet
and why they meet,

00:58:12.083 --> 00:58:13.333
or even to stop them,

00:58:13.916 --> 00:58:17.250
there's no option but to become
a member of that group.

00:58:18.208 --> 00:58:21.000
So?
Will you kill innocent people for that?

00:58:27.083 --> 00:58:28.166
Who's innocent?

00:58:28.833 --> 00:58:29.750
Him?

00:58:31.791 --> 00:58:33.083
A four-year-old girl.

00:58:34.458 --> 00:58:35.666
For eight days…

00:58:37.166 --> 00:58:39.250
Neighbors complained about the cries,

00:58:39.375 --> 00:58:40.916
and the police went to check.

00:58:45.833 --> 00:58:46.875
She was dead.

00:58:49.041 --> 00:58:51.125
The post-mortem revealed
that before her death…

00:58:54.458 --> 00:58:56.166
The one whom I killed before too…

00:58:59.166 --> 00:59:02.041
I need to upload the videos
and there's a format, that's why…

00:59:03.166 --> 00:59:05.208
If I had the creative freedom,

00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:08.250
I would have taken the time
to peel off the skin and…

00:59:08.541 --> 00:59:09.791
But they shouldn't die.

00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:15.250
Every part of his body has to be removed
right in front of his eyes.

00:59:23.375 --> 00:59:24.625
Sewage.

00:59:25.833 --> 00:59:27.541
That is where this scum belongs.

00:59:31.125 --> 00:59:32.833
What you thought is right.

00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:34.833
There is a criminal in me.

00:59:36.250 --> 00:59:38.500
But that criminal does
the duty of the police.

01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:06.583
Found something on the website
on the dark web. Please watch this video.

01:00:08.583 --> 01:00:10.083
Are you mad? Exit first.

01:00:10.750 --> 01:00:12.666
If he tracks us,
we can't execute our plan.

01:00:14.125 --> 01:00:15.125
It can't be tracked.

01:00:15.666 --> 01:00:16.833
I'm using a VPN.

01:00:17.625 --> 01:00:20.000
Why do you think so little of me?
Because I'm a girl?

01:00:21.666 --> 01:00:22.541
Yes!

01:00:23.041 --> 01:00:24.166
Tell me what it is.

01:00:27.333 --> 01:00:28.416
Watch this video.

01:00:29.791 --> 01:00:30.750
What about it?

01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:34.958
Do you see the fort in the backdrop?
That's in a place called Samode in Jaipur.

01:00:35.041 --> 01:00:36.750
I was posted there
for a few weeks.

01:00:39.041 --> 01:00:39.875
So?

01:00:40.333 --> 01:00:43.791
This murder has already taken place.
This would've already been reported.

01:00:43.958 --> 01:00:45.000
The point is,

01:00:45.083 --> 01:00:47.791
the person who uploaded this video
has uploaded only one video.

01:00:47.875 --> 01:00:49.833
It means he has committed
only one murder.

01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:57.583
That means he has yet to commit
the second murder.

01:00:58.291 --> 01:01:00.958
So, he'll commit the second one soon.
We can stop it.

01:01:02.416 --> 01:01:03.458
Good job, Varsha!

01:01:05.041 --> 01:01:07.958
Not because you are a girl.
I really mean it.

01:01:10.458 --> 01:01:13.208
Alert the Jaipur police.
Send them screenshots of his pictures.

01:01:13.291 --> 01:01:14.416
Start a manhunt.

01:01:44.083 --> 01:01:45.208
Watch this video.

01:01:49.541 --> 01:01:51.416
And the logo,
inside the jacket.

01:01:52.166 --> 01:01:53.291
Castrol?

01:01:54.708 --> 01:01:57.916
This... is worn by
the petrol station workers.

01:01:58.541 --> 01:01:59.500
Correct.

01:01:59.708 --> 01:02:02.291
Question the petrol station staff
in Samode, Jaipur.

01:02:02.375 --> 01:02:04.375
Search the entire town.

01:02:05.125 --> 01:02:06.125
Sir.

01:02:07.166 --> 01:02:08.541
He will certainly kill.

01:02:10.416 --> 01:02:12.250
He could kill today or a week from now.

01:02:12.375 --> 01:02:13.833
But he will definitely kill.

01:02:13.958 --> 01:02:19.166
A soldier fearlessly walks
into the fire to defend those at risk.

01:02:19.541 --> 01:02:22.125
To save a single life,

01:02:22.583 --> 01:02:25.166
he works tirelessly night and day,

01:02:25.458 --> 01:02:28.250
he asks many people for help,

01:02:28.541 --> 01:02:32.958
and he even goes hungry for many days.

01:02:33.208 --> 01:02:35.208
Only he knows all this.

01:02:35.375 --> 01:02:37.583
Once he faces all these hurdles,

01:02:37.666 --> 01:02:41.291
only he who is capable of
enduring it successfully

01:02:41.625 --> 01:02:46.083
can turn his energy towards
protection of righteousness.

01:02:53.791 --> 01:02:54.833
Hey!

01:03:11.708 --> 01:03:12.541
Sir?

01:03:13.291 --> 01:03:14.625
I asked for a leave.

01:03:14.875 --> 01:03:16.708
-What for?
-My daughter's annual day.

01:03:16.875 --> 01:03:18.583
-When?
-The end of this month.

01:03:22.833 --> 01:03:23.875
No. I won't give.

01:03:31.541 --> 01:03:34.708
-Sarkaar, please come in for Varsha.
-I'm leaving from the guest house.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.833
You asked me to come.
I'm here!

01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:41.500
I have a return flight
in three hours.

01:03:46.458 --> 01:03:50.416
-You came to Jaipur… for me?
-Yes!

01:03:52.791 --> 01:03:54.083
Just for a couple of hours?

01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:57.750
Right.

01:03:59.083 --> 01:04:00.083
Right!

01:04:17.291 --> 01:04:18.500
Don't be greedy.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.250
Let's save it for later.

01:04:27.250 --> 01:04:28.333
On an auspicious day.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.208
This is for you.

01:04:38.083 --> 01:04:40.333
Are you good, Arjun?

01:04:43.625 --> 01:04:45.208
Are you eating well, son?

01:04:45.833 --> 01:04:48.500
What? Do you never laugh?

01:04:49.541 --> 01:04:51.458
You always wear an angry expression.

01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:54.000
My Arjun isn't like that.

01:04:54.458 --> 01:04:55.958
You should be smiling, Arjun.

01:04:56.791 --> 01:04:58.250
You look good when you laugh.

01:04:58.750 --> 01:05:00.416
Don't pick a fight with your dad.

01:05:00.791 --> 01:05:02.041
You're always a star.

01:05:02.458 --> 01:05:03.416
Live up to it.

01:05:23.458 --> 01:05:24.375
Go, Varsha.

01:05:24.875 --> 01:05:25.750
Varsha, tell me.

01:05:25.958 --> 01:05:29.166
The team is near Ajmer gate.
We can get to work once you're here.

01:05:29.291 --> 01:05:31.625
-We're stopping all the heavy vehicles.
-Close all the barricades.

01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:33.541
We're checking everything,
including the car boots.

01:05:33.625 --> 01:05:35.625
Just be more vigilant
with the bigger vehicles.

01:05:35.708 --> 01:05:37.291
-Okay, sir.
-I'm coming.

01:05:37.583 --> 01:05:38.458
Okay, sir.

01:05:39.625 --> 01:05:41.791
-I'll be there in 20 minutes.
-Okay, sir.

01:05:45.666 --> 01:05:46.708
I have to go.

01:05:48.625 --> 01:05:50.583
-A car to the airport?
-I'll take a cab.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:52.958
Go!

01:07:45.416 --> 01:07:47.000
Hey! Move it!

01:07:49.750 --> 01:07:51.666
Move it! Fast!

01:08:17.083 --> 01:08:19.333
-Did you see a pickup truck here?
-No. What happened?

01:08:24.458 --> 01:08:25.375
Torch.

01:08:26.458 --> 01:08:28.083
He isn't a petrol station worker.

01:08:28.458 --> 01:08:29.666
Roadside assistance guy.

01:08:30.083 --> 01:08:32.833
-No one should pass this way. Close it.
-Okay, sir.

01:09:42.583 --> 01:09:46.166
Alright, batch 2002.
Let's learn about knife stabs today.

01:09:46.416 --> 01:09:47.500
Important point.

01:09:47.583 --> 01:09:51.416
Pulling the knife out causes more damage
to the body than the stab itself.

01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:54.833
So, in case you get stabbed, don't let
your opponent pull the knife out.

01:09:54.916 --> 01:09:56.666
-Got that?
-Yes, sir.

01:13:11.583 --> 01:13:13.000
I found a snake on the road.

01:13:14.583 --> 01:13:16.041
I killed it. I'm coming.

01:13:16.958 --> 01:13:18.958
I'll reach in an hour or two.

01:13:19.375 --> 01:13:21.166
Yes. Is that okay?

01:13:21.708 --> 01:13:22.583
Alright, then.

01:15:07.666 --> 01:15:10.666
You should check from a distance
if the snake is dead or not.

01:15:12.458 --> 01:15:13.833
Instead…

01:15:14.333 --> 01:15:16.750
Don't grab its tail and show off.

01:16:12.541 --> 01:16:13.541
Give me the laptop.

01:16:38.666 --> 01:16:40.791
All these guys meet up once every year.

01:16:40.875 --> 01:16:43.083
I was told to take the Arunai Express
to Arunachal Pradesh

01:16:43.166 --> 01:16:45.583
and wait at the bus stop
by the Naharlagun railway station.

01:16:45.666 --> 01:16:47.583
I have no clue
where they’ll take me from there.

01:16:47.666 --> 01:16:50.458
This is the only shot we’ve got
to nab the entire group.

01:16:50.541 --> 01:16:52.416
How did you join this group, Sarkaar?

01:16:57.708 --> 01:16:58.541
Please, sir…

01:16:58.958 --> 01:17:00.708
Please understand the urgency.

01:17:01.291 --> 01:17:03.333
Why are you so obsessed with it?

01:17:03.708 --> 01:17:06.375
What is…
What is so personal about it, Sarkaar?

01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:08.583
Criminals, sir.

01:17:09.916 --> 01:17:12.041
They belong in a ten-foot lockup

01:17:12.166 --> 01:17:14.250
or deep inside a six-foot hole.

01:17:15.541 --> 01:17:17.500
No criminal should be free to walk around

01:17:17.583 --> 01:17:19.833
until they’ve faced
real behavioral correction.

01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:23.625
You don’t have to be personally
affected to feel that way.

01:17:24.916 --> 01:17:26.333
Just being a police officer is enough.

01:17:26.416 --> 01:17:28.291
Said who? ADGP Raajan?

01:17:30.583 --> 01:17:31.458
Your grandfather.

01:17:32.291 --> 01:17:33.916
ADGP Raajan Sarkaar.

01:17:37.625 --> 01:17:39.625
Don't tell me there's nothing personal.

01:17:41.083 --> 01:17:42.166
Trust me, sir.

01:17:42.958 --> 01:17:44.166
There's nothing personal.

01:17:44.250 --> 01:17:45.916
Handle this like a covert operation.

01:17:46.833 --> 01:17:48.708
Arunachal Pradesh is a border state.

01:17:48.875 --> 01:17:50.666
The situation there is already tense.

01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:53.000
So, don't escalate the issue.

01:17:53.875 --> 01:17:56.000
I’ll have someone from my team join yours.

01:17:56.416 --> 01:17:58.958
I want unfiltered updates from there.

01:18:17.708 --> 01:18:18.625
Sarkaar!

01:18:18.916 --> 01:18:21.125
This is Officer Mrudula, my new recruit.

01:18:21.250 --> 01:18:22.166
Mrudula…

01:18:22.333 --> 01:18:23.833
Meet Sarkaar and his team.

01:18:24.541 --> 01:18:25.541
Sir.

01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:28.916
She reports directly to me.

01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:31.083
She's very honest and reliable.

01:18:31.333 --> 01:18:32.916
-Sir, honest and?
-Reliable.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.250
Reliable!

01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:46.666
Listen to me carefu--

01:18:47.416 --> 01:18:48.291
Focus.

01:18:50.833 --> 01:18:53.625
Everyone, scatter and take a seat
in different compartments.

01:18:53.708 --> 01:18:55.416
I’ll be getting off at Naharlagun station.

01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:56.666
You, too, get off there.

01:18:56.750 --> 01:18:59.541
They asked me to toss my phone and wallet
in the trash can outside.

01:18:59.625 --> 01:19:00.875
That means no contact.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.791
They've mentioned they'll pick me up
from the bus stop,

01:19:03.875 --> 01:19:06.000
which is one kilometer from the station.

01:19:06.083 --> 01:19:08.791
I've arranged a vehicle
500 meters from the bus stop.

01:19:08.875 --> 01:19:11.708
It's a ghost vehicle, basically.
Every inch of it is painted black.

01:19:11.791 --> 01:19:13.000
The headlights will be off.

01:19:13.083 --> 01:19:15.166
You’ll need to follow us
at a safe distance.

01:19:15.250 --> 01:19:17.500
By seeing where they're taking me,

01:19:17.583 --> 01:19:20.458
you can guess the scale of the operation
and move forward.

01:19:20.541 --> 01:19:22.166
-Any questions?
-No, sir.

01:19:23.250 --> 01:19:24.166
Disperse.

01:19:37.333 --> 01:19:38.958
Can I talk to you for two minutes?

01:19:40.583 --> 01:19:41.500
No.

01:19:58.125 --> 01:19:59.625
Move, and I'll push you out.

01:20:04.125 --> 01:20:05.750
I just need two minutes.

01:20:07.083 --> 01:20:08.875
Nageswara Rao told you to follow me.

01:20:09.625 --> 01:20:10.750
That's why you met me.

01:20:11.791 --> 01:20:13.208
That's why you came to Jaipur.

01:20:14.291 --> 01:20:15.375
Mom's video, too.

01:20:16.833 --> 01:20:17.916
This is your version.

01:20:18.083 --> 01:20:19.708
But I met you four years ago.

01:20:19.791 --> 01:20:23.250
My sister was harassed
by a guy at Vizag Beach Road.

01:20:25.166 --> 01:20:27.291
I’ve heard that it happens
quite frequently over there.

01:20:27.375 --> 01:20:28.625
But that day…

01:20:28.750 --> 01:20:31.833
Seeing it happen to my sister,
I felt so helpless.

01:20:32.125 --> 01:20:33.208
That's when I saw.

01:20:33.791 --> 01:20:34.875
For the first time.

01:20:35.333 --> 01:20:36.458
The Arjun Sarkaar.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.416
That was the day I decided
to become a police officer.

01:21:05.208 --> 01:21:06.666
Four years later,

01:21:06.750 --> 01:21:09.416
you showed up at my academy
to give a guest lecture.

01:21:10.041 --> 01:21:12.666
I finally got to take
a closer look at you.

01:21:12.791 --> 01:21:14.416
I’ve heard so much about you.

01:21:14.958 --> 01:21:17.125
From all that,

01:21:17.583 --> 01:21:19.208
I shouldn't even have liked you.

01:21:20.291 --> 01:21:21.916
But I just kept falling for you.

01:21:22.791 --> 01:21:24.291
Then what about the matrimony site?

01:21:24.375 --> 01:21:27.125
I thought I’d confess my love
after getting my posting.

01:21:27.250 --> 01:21:30.125
Then I learned that you won’t marry
anyone from the department.

01:21:31.208 --> 01:21:32.375
That's why…

01:21:32.666 --> 01:21:33.708
That's why?

01:21:35.208 --> 01:21:36.333
I got greedy.

01:21:42.583 --> 01:21:43.416
What now?

01:21:49.666 --> 01:21:51.083
Let's not save it for later.

01:22:20.083 --> 01:22:23.458
While we sleep,
both the AC and the fan must be running.

Do you have anything else to say?
Mrs. Sarkaar?

01:24:59.750 --> 01:25:01.291
The most important thing is…

01:25:01.708 --> 01:25:04.083
I want your face to be
my first sight each morning.

01:25:04.166 --> 01:25:05.166
Not your photo.

01:25:07.375 --> 01:25:08.291
So…

01:25:09.625 --> 01:25:11.458
Careful, Mr. Mrudula.

01:25:24.583 --> 01:25:29.583
Just as Lord Shiva's damaru
roars without pause,

01:25:29.916 --> 01:25:34.541
a warrior who walks toward dharma
with such a heartbeat

01:25:34.833 --> 01:25:36.125
is equal to Abhimanyu.

01:25:36.250 --> 01:25:41.333
{\an8}Today, with that same spirit,
that warrior enters the Padmavyuha.

01:26:32.125 --> 01:26:33.916
Shit! Which one is he in?

01:26:34.541 --> 01:26:36.000
They're misleading us, madam.

01:27:04.625 --> 01:27:06.375
They’re splitting up.
Diwakar!

01:27:53.125 --> 01:27:54.791
I noticed some people
entering the building,

01:27:54.875 --> 01:27:56.791
but I can’t confirm
if Sarkaar was with them.

01:27:56.875 --> 01:27:59.583
-Diwakar?
-They're entering an abandoned building.

01:27:59.666 --> 01:28:01.416
Get to the local police station now!

01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:03.541
-We’ll raid them with the force.
-Okay.

01:28:03.625 --> 01:28:06.250
I’m certain Arjun is at
one of these three locations.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:47.958
Hi, AJ. I'm Alpha.

01:29:49.625 --> 01:29:52.250
My apologies for the disguises
and the three cars.

01:29:52.541 --> 01:29:55.916
It's a small strategy we rely on
when we're picking up new people.

01:29:56.083 --> 01:29:57.250
Your Telugu is spot on!

01:29:57.333 --> 01:29:59.083
We can communicate in a lot of languages.

01:30:18.041 --> 01:30:19.666
-Fancy.
-Not really.

01:30:20.458 --> 01:30:22.000
About 150 years ago,

01:30:22.375 --> 01:30:24.166
this place was a royal Burmese palace.

01:30:25.083 --> 01:30:28.708
The Arunachal Pradesh government
later ran a hospital here.

01:30:28.791 --> 01:30:31.958
But for the last 40 years,
it's been abandoned.

01:30:32.375 --> 01:30:33.625
On one day of the year,

01:30:34.583 --> 01:30:36.208
this becomes our playground.

01:30:40.458 --> 01:30:41.708
Your playground is nice!

01:30:42.458 --> 01:30:43.458
What's the game?

01:30:47.583 --> 01:30:48.750
You'll know soon, AJ.

01:30:49.958 --> 01:30:50.958
Relax.

01:30:51.333 --> 01:30:52.541
I'll come and get you.

01:31:35.916 --> 01:31:38.250
{\an8}Correct, sir.
We marked three locations.

01:31:38.666 --> 01:31:39.958
{\an8}We have to move faster, sir.

01:31:40.041 --> 01:31:42.208
{\an8}We have to track down
Arjun's location right away!

01:31:42.291 --> 01:31:43.250
He's in danger.

01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:45.625
We'll lose everything
before sunrise, sir.

01:31:46.125 --> 01:31:47.291
Okay, don't panic.

01:31:47.375 --> 01:31:50.541
What now? You need to raid not one
but three locations. Is that right?

01:31:50.625 --> 01:31:53.166
-Without knowing what's--
-Mrudula, I know you're worried!

01:31:53.250 --> 01:31:55.291
Just hang on.
We'll handle it, okay?

01:32:00.375 --> 01:32:01.333
AJ.

01:32:28.083 --> 01:32:29.125
Class.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.916
That's how people were fooled
all these years.

01:32:35.541 --> 01:32:36.625
I'll show you…

01:32:37.041 --> 01:32:37.958
the original.

01:32:38.666 --> 01:32:39.541
Let's go.

01:34:32.833 --> 01:34:33.833
Guys!

01:34:34.833 --> 01:34:35.958
Meet our new members.

01:34:36.041 --> 01:34:39.208
CTK!

01:34:49.916 --> 01:34:54.041
Choose one pole and cut its rope, AJ.
Go for it!

01:35:12.041 --> 01:35:13.000
Good!

01:35:13.541 --> 01:35:14.541
Next.

01:35:28.041 --> 01:35:30.208
Brothers and sisters of CTK!

01:35:30.875 --> 01:35:32.000
Why?

01:35:34.666 --> 01:35:36.166
Why are we like this?

01:35:36.916 --> 01:35:38.416
Why are we here?

01:35:40.458 --> 01:35:42.250
We all have our reasons.

01:35:42.458 --> 01:35:44.750
You have a reason. I have a reason.

01:35:45.208 --> 01:35:47.083
Everyone has a different reason.

01:35:47.500 --> 01:35:49.708
But what's common between all of us?

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.166
What do we all need?

01:35:53.791 --> 01:35:54.750
Freedom.

01:35:55.833 --> 01:35:56.833
Freedom!

01:35:58.666 --> 01:36:01.375
-Freedom!
-Freedom!

01:36:03.208 --> 01:36:05.208
They differentiate between good and bad.

01:36:05.291 --> 01:36:06.583
Who decides that?

01:36:08.083 --> 01:36:11.666
Who the fuck defines
what's good and what's bad?

01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:14.791
Society?

01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:17.041
Fuck society.

01:36:18.541 --> 01:36:19.458
Law!

01:36:19.666 --> 01:36:20.583
Justice.

01:36:20.791 --> 01:36:21.708
Morals.

01:36:21.833 --> 01:36:24.041
They were all introduced
just to control us.

01:36:24.125 --> 01:36:26.041
They all only control us.

01:36:27.791 --> 01:36:30.458
To keep us as their obedient slaves.

01:36:30.958 --> 01:36:32.708
Do you want to be their fucking slaves?

01:36:32.791 --> 01:36:34.083
No!

01:36:35.291 --> 01:36:37.083
That's why we've built this place.

01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:38.833
CTK!

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:41.916
They call these murders.

01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:45.000
But we call this freedom.

01:36:45.333 --> 01:36:46.958
They say this is a crime.

01:36:47.166 --> 01:36:48.916
We say this is evolution.

01:36:49.125 --> 01:36:50.791
They say we're psychos.

01:36:51.833 --> 01:36:53.791
I say we're the solution.

01:36:54.583 --> 01:36:56.916
There's only one rule in CTK.

01:36:59.625 --> 01:37:00.625
Freedom…

01:37:01.250 --> 01:37:03.875
in its absolute and purest form.

01:37:06.500 --> 01:37:07.500
Freedom.

01:37:52.291 --> 01:37:53.666
You're free.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:09.250
Welcome to CTK.

01:38:09.708 --> 01:38:11.000
This is just the beginning.

01:38:11.666 --> 01:38:12.750
Let's go wild.

01:38:15.208 --> 01:38:16.291
Cage 6.

01:38:16.750 --> 01:38:17.666
One hour.

01:38:31.125 --> 01:38:32.333
Let's go to my room.

01:38:35.833 --> 01:38:37.833
I'm taken, committed.

01:38:39.166 --> 01:38:40.291
So what?

01:38:41.250 --> 01:38:42.500
Don't you want this?

01:38:49.250 --> 01:38:50.625
Not my league.

01:39:45.541 --> 01:39:46.958
Police!

01:39:49.750 --> 01:39:51.375
Police will come.

01:39:51.708 --> 01:39:53.416
You can't kill us.

01:40:49.875 --> 01:40:50.958
Yeah. I'm sending it.

01:40:51.291 --> 01:40:52.416
Don't call me again.

01:43:10.666 --> 01:43:11.958
-Hello?
-Ma'am.

01:43:12.708 --> 01:43:13.875
There's no one here.

01:43:14.416 --> 01:43:15.416
And your SI…

01:43:15.791 --> 01:43:17.166
Diwakar has gone missing.

01:43:23.791 --> 01:43:25.750
Go! Go! Fall back!

01:43:30.041 --> 01:43:31.000
Sit, sit.

01:43:33.500 --> 01:43:36.000
Hello? Mrudula, there's no trace
of Sarkaar here either.

01:43:36.208 --> 01:43:38.958
We're being attacked. It's not safe.
I need you to get out.

01:44:52.458 --> 01:44:53.416
Are you mad!

01:44:53.583 --> 01:44:55.916
He'd have known Arjun's location.
Why did you kill him?

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:57.333
-Ma'am--
-They went this way.

01:44:57.416 --> 01:44:58.750
Go and search in the forest.

01:45:04.500 --> 01:45:05.625
Sorry.

01:45:27.916 --> 01:45:29.958
Are we ready, CTK?

01:45:30.041 --> 01:45:32.250
Yeah!

01:45:48.291 --> 01:45:49.833
Come on!

01:45:52.458 --> 01:45:53.750
Yeah!

01:45:53.958 --> 01:45:55.083
Get.

01:45:56.416 --> 01:45:57.541
Set.

01:45:58.708 --> 01:45:59.708
Go!

01:46:30.166 --> 01:46:31.916
Everybody, back to your rooms!

01:46:33.333 --> 01:46:34.625
Back to your bloody rooms.

01:46:35.666 --> 01:46:38.000
Hound, put him back in his cell.

01:46:43.333 --> 01:46:44.375
{\an8}Mrudula, what's happening?

01:46:44.458 --> 01:46:46.166
Arjun is not in any of
the three marked locations.

01:46:46.250 --> 01:46:47.083
We lost him.

01:46:47.166 --> 01:46:49.375
They've taken Diwakar as well.

01:46:49.458 --> 01:46:50.583
Oh shit!

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.875
We're beginning a search operation
with the help of a local team.

01:46:53.958 --> 01:46:55.500
Do not step out of the police station.

01:46:55.583 --> 01:46:56.791
-Sir?
-Your safety is my priority.

01:46:56.875 --> 01:46:59.916
Don't do anything until you
get instructions from me. Got it?

01:47:00.875 --> 01:47:02.500
What's this nonsense, Varsha?

01:47:02.583 --> 01:47:05.458
Why don't they approve a search operation
when team members are in danger?

01:47:05.541 --> 01:47:08.041
I'm sure the meeting place
is in the nearby forest.

01:47:08.625 --> 01:47:09.916
Let's begin an unofficial search.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:11.791
We lost Diwakar in an earlier attempt.

01:47:12.125 --> 01:47:13.500
It might not be safe, Mrudula.

01:47:13.666 --> 01:47:15.916
I'm going.
You can come if you want to.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.500
{\an8}Do you know
why this place has no CCTV cameras?

01:47:23.666 --> 01:47:24.958
This is our principle.

01:47:25.416 --> 01:47:28.000
Loyalty, brotherhood, and trust.

01:47:28.208 --> 01:47:29.625
Now for the first time…

01:47:30.791 --> 01:47:31.708
it failed.

01:47:33.375 --> 01:47:35.000
The missing radio in the pickup car…

01:47:35.083 --> 01:47:36.916
My satellite phone being tampered with…

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:38.416
Now, there's a blast in the kitchen.

01:47:38.500 --> 01:47:40.416
The three misleading locations we use

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:45.083
while picking up new members
were attacked by the police.

01:47:48.083 --> 01:47:50.083
The police have infiltrated our group.

01:47:54.500 --> 01:47:57.416
New members… step into the ring.

01:48:09.375 --> 01:48:10.833
One of them is a cop,

01:48:11.291 --> 01:48:12.833
and four CTK members.

01:48:13.125 --> 01:48:15.250
CTK members kill for passion.

01:48:16.625 --> 01:48:19.333
The police kill for survival.

01:48:19.958 --> 01:48:21.791
A cop will certainly die.

01:48:22.833 --> 01:48:26.916
The one who survives is
my strongest CTK member.

01:48:29.333 --> 01:48:30.875
Only one of you must survive.

01:48:32.041 --> 01:48:33.041
Fight.

01:48:35.291 --> 01:48:39.250
Freedom, freedom, freedom.

01:48:39.416 --> 01:48:44.166
Freedom, freedom, freedom.

01:48:44.291 --> 01:48:48.291
Freedom, freedom, freedom.

01:48:48.458 --> 01:48:52.375
Freedom, freedom, freedom.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:59.125
Among all those lunatics,
I’m scared for Arjun’s safety, Varsha.

01:48:59.541 --> 01:49:02.125
Freedom, freedom, freedom.

01:49:02.333 --> 01:49:06.041
Freedom, freedom, freedom.

01:49:06.125 --> 01:49:09.458
Freedom, freedom, freedom.

01:49:09.583 --> 01:49:11.166
Nothing will happen to Sarkaar.

01:49:11.250 --> 01:49:14.291
He's the most dangerous psycho
among them all.

01:49:23.291 --> 01:49:25.791
Freedom, freedom. Ooh!

01:49:34.416 --> 01:49:37.125
Hey!

01:49:46.333 --> 01:49:50.750
-Ooh!
-Yeah.

01:50:06.250 --> 01:50:10.500
Freedom, freedom, freedom.

01:50:25.875 --> 01:50:28.625
Freedom, freedom, freedom.

01:50:38.750 --> 01:50:43.500
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:50:43.625 --> 01:50:48.416
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:50:48.541 --> 01:50:51.000
Go, go, go!

01:50:51.125 --> 01:50:53.458
You don't want this?

01:50:54.500 --> 01:50:58.416
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.333
You can't survive here.

01:51:53.583 --> 01:51:56.166
I've been hearing this
since the start of my career.

01:52:02.458 --> 01:52:05.875
Freedom, freedom,
freedom, freedom.

01:52:05.958 --> 01:52:07.958
Freedom, freedom, freedom.

01:52:08.250 --> 01:52:09.291
Hey!

01:52:16.916 --> 01:52:21.416
AJ, only a trained police officer could've
take down four CTK members, right?

01:52:22.916 --> 01:52:25.541
So much technique, method, and--

01:52:25.666 --> 01:52:26.791
Am I in the police?

01:52:29.583 --> 01:52:30.875
The more you doubt,

01:52:32.166 --> 01:52:33.541
the more I get to play.

01:52:33.958 --> 01:52:34.958
Go ahead.

01:52:37.416 --> 01:52:38.541
Hound.

01:52:55.125 --> 01:52:56.041
Do you know him?

01:52:57.583 --> 01:52:58.500
Yes.

01:52:58.916 --> 01:53:00.250
He's my boss.

01:53:00.791 --> 01:53:02.250
He's a police officer.

01:53:08.458 --> 01:53:09.541
It could be true.

01:53:09.625 --> 01:53:10.833
Or it could be false.

01:53:11.708 --> 01:53:12.916
You think you're smart?

01:53:18.625 --> 01:53:20.083
Those were good kills.

01:53:20.666 --> 01:53:22.000
Kill one more person.

01:53:22.625 --> 01:53:24.333
Then, I'll believe you're not a cop.

01:53:25.708 --> 01:53:26.958
Kill him.

01:53:31.916 --> 01:53:36.541
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!

01:53:42.125 --> 01:53:44.458
Kill me, sir.
If we're caught, they'll kill us both.

01:53:46.333 --> 01:53:48.083
Don't you have to attend
your daughter's annual day event?

01:53:48.166 --> 01:53:49.333
Keep going. Don't stop.

01:53:52.041 --> 01:53:53.750
Kill him, kill him!

01:54:11.583 --> 01:54:12.666
AJ, stop.

01:54:19.041 --> 01:54:20.333
He's a cop.

01:54:20.875 --> 01:54:21.833
He is the cop.

01:54:22.083 --> 01:54:24.125
We found the broken radio circuit
in his room.

01:54:33.916 --> 01:54:35.083
AJ, relax.

01:54:36.208 --> 01:54:37.750
Hound, finish him.

01:54:37.958 --> 01:54:39.208
Mind…

01:54:39.750 --> 01:54:40.958
Have you lost it?

01:54:44.166 --> 01:54:45.916
Three CTK members died.

01:54:46.708 --> 01:54:48.208
Freedom means killing others,

01:54:48.458 --> 01:54:49.875
not killing ourselves.

01:54:51.333 --> 01:54:54.416
I believed you when you talked about
CTK, brotherhood, and loyalty!

01:54:54.500 --> 01:54:57.000
We uploaded murder videos
with our faces visible.

01:55:01.958 --> 01:55:05.208
When that cop created a fake profile
and uploaded two murder videos,

01:55:05.291 --> 01:55:07.291
how could you approve them
without verifying them?

01:55:11.541 --> 01:55:13.166
You're calling that dead man a cop.

01:55:14.541 --> 01:55:16.291
You want me to kill the cop we captured.

01:55:18.500 --> 01:55:20.541
How certain are we that
none of them is a cop?

01:55:20.750 --> 01:55:22.583
What's the guarantee?

01:55:26.541 --> 01:55:28.041
Before he dies,

01:55:28.791 --> 01:55:31.375
I must know everything he knows.

01:55:32.208 --> 01:55:34.125
I need one hour with him.

01:55:34.625 --> 01:55:36.750
I'll make him confess everything.

01:55:57.791 --> 01:55:59.583
Where the fuck did you learn that, AJ?

01:55:59.666 --> 01:56:01.708
That's some impressive
fucking stuff, dude.

01:56:01.875 --> 01:56:02.916
One hour.

01:56:06.125 --> 01:56:08.333
CTK will not go down today.

01:56:09.208 --> 01:56:10.708
Prepare for the final act.

01:56:10.875 --> 01:56:12.625
Let's get the hell out of this place.

01:56:35.166 --> 01:56:36.500
Mrudula, are you okay?

01:56:45.250 --> 01:56:46.916
I don't know what will happen next.

01:56:48.333 --> 01:56:50.250
But no one should die here.

01:56:50.583 --> 01:56:52.458
I'll create a diversion from behind.

01:56:52.666 --> 01:56:54.125
The focus will shift to me.

01:56:54.916 --> 01:56:56.291
That will be your chance.

01:56:56.750 --> 01:56:59.083
Move all the victims
to the corridors immediately.

01:57:00.166 --> 01:57:01.333
I'll find you there.

01:57:01.416 --> 01:57:03.958
There are more than 150 members, sir.

01:57:07.916 --> 01:57:09.666
Six-foot corridors.

01:57:10.791 --> 01:57:13.250
No matter how many you target,
attack them one by one.

01:57:13.500 --> 01:57:14.958
That will be our advantage.

01:57:15.375 --> 01:57:17.416
Once we cross the corridors,

01:57:17.958 --> 01:57:19.375
boxing ring.

01:57:21.708 --> 01:57:23.291
Then, the main lobby.

01:57:24.583 --> 01:57:26.333
From there, we enter the forest.

01:57:28.791 --> 01:57:31.208
Sir, is all of this really possible?

01:57:35.500 --> 01:57:37.208
I'll never wear the uniform, Diwa.

01:57:38.791 --> 01:57:40.041
But there are days when…

01:57:41.458 --> 01:57:44.500
even in civilian clothes, I still feel
like I'm wearing the uniform.

01:57:46.125 --> 01:57:47.250
Today is that day.

01:57:48.791 --> 01:57:52.166
It's my duty to get you and the victims
safely out of this building.

01:57:53.041 --> 01:57:55.500
From that point, you should
take them to a safe place.

01:57:55.625 --> 01:57:57.166
Sir, what about you?

01:57:59.291 --> 01:58:00.625
I'll hold the fort.

01:58:02.083 --> 01:58:05.083
Let's see how high I can score.

01:58:10.083 --> 01:58:11.125
Run.

01:58:13.083 --> 01:58:14.583
Run for your life.

01:58:27.458 --> 01:58:32.000
Let me know if you see any fenced areas,
isolated structures or big compound walls.

01:58:32.125 --> 01:58:33.375
You go right.

01:58:57.083 --> 01:59:00.166
Mrudula, we've moved
150 meters in from the road.

01:59:00.375 --> 01:59:01.500
But there is nothing yet.

01:59:02.625 --> 01:59:04.791
-I'm going deeper.
-Okay, Varsha.

01:59:28.625 --> 01:59:30.000
His name is Diwakar.

01:59:30.250 --> 01:59:31.750
Karnataka HIT police.

01:59:32.083 --> 01:59:33.083
HIT?

01:59:34.041 --> 01:59:36.166
Weirdos among killers are CTK.

01:59:37.375 --> 01:59:39.000
And weirdos among cops…

01:59:39.625 --> 01:59:40.750
are HIT.

01:59:42.083 --> 01:59:44.666
They've been investigating CTK
for the past three years.

01:59:44.750 --> 01:59:46.208
All our members are clean.

01:59:46.500 --> 01:59:47.625
Nothing to worry about.

01:59:48.416 --> 01:59:49.416
Relax.

01:59:53.416 --> 01:59:55.958
Mrudula, there's nothing yet.
We're going in the next batch.

01:59:56.041 --> 01:59:58.750
-What's happening with you?
-Varsha, stay silent for a minute.

02:00:00.500 --> 02:00:02.291
-What's that sound?
-What sound?

02:00:03.333 --> 02:00:04.541
Static disturbance.

02:00:05.500 --> 02:00:07.750
Walkie. I think there's some interference.

02:00:09.208 --> 02:00:11.416
-Which walkie produced that sound?
-This one.

02:00:14.958 --> 02:00:17.083
Shift all walkie frequencies to 155 Hz.

02:00:17.208 --> 02:00:18.250
Shift it.

02:00:27.666 --> 02:00:28.875
These are radio waves.

02:00:29.958 --> 02:00:31.958
Arjun is an expert
in radio communication.

02:00:32.333 --> 02:00:34.416
He's trying to reach us.

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:37.708
The source must be very close.

02:00:45.875 --> 02:00:48.583
The signal is gaining strength
on this side.

02:00:49.666 --> 02:00:50.791
This side, guys.

02:00:51.625 --> 02:00:54.000
{\an8}Time for the final act,
ladies and gentlemen.

02:00:57.416 --> 02:01:01.333
I promised all of you
a great experience this year.

02:01:02.083 --> 02:01:03.416
And I'm here to deliver.

02:01:05.041 --> 02:01:07.416
There's a line that humans cannot cross.

02:01:08.708 --> 02:01:11.583
A certain boundary
that even we don't cross.

02:01:12.375 --> 02:01:16.500
Tonight… we're crossing that line.

02:01:18.666 --> 02:01:20.416
We're going to break that boundary.

02:01:21.791 --> 02:01:22.750
Hound!

02:02:30.041 --> 02:02:31.291
This baby…

02:02:32.291 --> 02:02:34.875
is untouched by the rot of this world!

02:02:35.208 --> 02:02:38.833
But we'll decide
the fate of this innocent life.

02:02:39.791 --> 02:02:41.208
What does that make us?

02:02:42.083 --> 02:02:43.125
God?

02:02:44.583 --> 02:02:45.708
Or Evil?

02:02:49.833 --> 02:02:51.125
I say, tonight,

02:02:52.791 --> 02:02:54.750
we show humans their true selves.

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:55.958
Tonight,

02:02:57.125 --> 02:02:58.750
we challenge humanity.

02:03:00.791 --> 02:03:02.666
CTK, are you ready?

02:03:02.833 --> 02:03:06.916
Yeah!

02:03:51.541 --> 02:03:52.958
Ten!

02:03:53.750 --> 02:03:55.375
Nine!

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:58.791
Eight!

02:03:59.708 --> 02:04:01.458
Sir, she’s only nine months old.

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:03.500
Seven!

02:04:08.875 --> 02:04:10.875
What could he possibly do to her?

02:04:11.041 --> 02:04:12.958
Six!

02:04:17.208 --> 02:04:19.000
Five!

02:04:19.208 --> 02:04:21.250
I want my baby back, sir.

02:04:26.375 --> 02:04:28.000
Four!

02:04:28.291 --> 02:04:29.583
My baby…

02:04:29.791 --> 02:04:31.458
Sir, my baby…

02:04:37.833 --> 02:04:39.500
Three!

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:44.875
Two!

02:04:53.291 --> 02:04:55.375
One!

02:04:56.125 --> 02:04:58.000
I will bring her back.

02:05:02.083 --> 02:05:04.583
This time…

02:05:05.291 --> 02:05:07.083
it's Arjun Sarkaar.

02:05:21.875 --> 02:05:23.041
Diwa!

02:05:25.625 --> 02:05:27.125
Yes, sir.

02:15:24.416 --> 02:15:25.833
But it's not the Arunachal police.

02:15:43.458 --> 02:15:44.458

Hey!

02:17:16.875 --> 02:17:18.500
Sir, it's not opening.

Sir…

02:17:37.416 --> 02:17:38.583
Close the door!

02:17:44.625 --> 02:17:46.458
Arjun Sarkaar.

02:17:55.958 --> 02:17:57.250
Where are they going to go?

02:17:59.500 --> 02:18:01.041
We'll catch all the rats.

Mrudula.

02:23:51.875 --> 02:23:53.125
It's an auspicious day.

02:23:54.583 --> 02:23:55.708
Propose!

02:24:06.291 --> 02:24:07.875
The situation is under control, sir.

02:24:08.875 --> 02:24:09.791
Sarkaar is okay.

02:24:29.041 --> 02:24:30.333
When taking a life,

02:24:30.666 --> 02:24:35.375
their eyes should reflect
either fear or sorrow.

02:24:36.625 --> 02:24:39.125
Otherwise, the killer won’t feel
any satisfaction.

02:24:40.541 --> 02:24:41.583
Look at me.

02:24:43.333 --> 02:24:45.000
I won't give you that satisfaction.

02:24:52.875 --> 02:24:54.375

Everything is closed.

02:25:22.208 --> 02:25:23.708
{\an8}What about the organs?

02:25:25.041 --> 02:25:26.958
Four days ago, in Arunachal Pradesh,

02:25:27.041 --> 02:25:30.375
a police raid on Burma Palace
threw light on a dark world.

02:25:30.541 --> 02:25:32.708
{\an8}Humans were being killed
and their organs

02:25:32.791 --> 02:25:35.958
{\an8}were sent to
a Swedish company, Hormogenix.

02:25:36.208 --> 02:25:38.666
Hormogenix? I've heard this name before.

02:25:38.750 --> 02:25:40.708
-It's a Swedish pharma company.
-Correct.

02:25:40.791 --> 02:25:42.875
Didn't the same company
do money laundering

02:25:42.958 --> 02:25:44.541
through a charity organization?

02:25:44.625 --> 02:25:46.041
What's the name of the organization?

02:25:46.125 --> 02:25:47.708
-Keen to Care.
-KTC.

02:25:50.041 --> 02:25:52.000
Tech genius Samuel Joseph runs it.

02:25:52.416 --> 02:25:55.500
It's his most notorious collaboration
for the pharma deal.

02:25:55.583 --> 02:25:56.583
CTK.

02:25:56.833 --> 02:25:59.291
The CTK executes its victims
when they're gripped by fear,

02:25:59.375 --> 02:26:02.458
extracts their endocrine organs,
and supplies them to Hormogenix.

02:26:02.541 --> 02:26:05.708
After removing the organs
when the victims are in extreme stress,

02:26:05.791 --> 02:26:09.416
high concentrations of cortisol
and adrenaline are extracted

02:26:09.500 --> 02:26:11.000
to prepare a cocktail.

02:26:11.083 --> 02:26:16.625
Through that, they're preparing a drug
that boosts sex drive like no other.

02:26:16.791 --> 02:26:18.375
We keep hearing these things.
Right?

02:26:18.791 --> 02:26:21.375
Like, an 80-year-old
Hollywood actor having kids.

02:26:21.708 --> 02:26:24.458
And then a 70-year-old
businessman gets busted at sex parties.

02:26:24.541 --> 02:26:26.458
All these billionaires are
rich and powerful.

02:26:26.541 --> 02:26:29.375
They spend crores of rupees
to purchase this drug.

02:26:29.583 --> 02:26:33.666
This drug is being supplied extensively
in several lust parties abroad.

02:26:33.750 --> 02:26:38.041
The number of models and aspiring actors
who fell victim to rich old men…

02:26:38.125 --> 02:26:39.541
we'll only know in the coming days.

02:26:39.625 --> 02:26:43.708
Money earned through this is being sent
to several Indian charity organizations

02:26:44.250 --> 02:26:45.541
as black money.

02:26:45.833 --> 02:26:48.250
The officer investigating
this money laundering case

02:26:48.333 --> 02:26:49.833
has been missing
for the past three months.

02:26:49.916 --> 02:26:51.041
That missing officer…

02:26:51.125 --> 02:26:53.458
is the only one I couldn't save
in this mission.

02:26:55.041 --> 02:26:56.583
ACP Dhanya.

02:27:01.208 --> 02:27:03.333
I came here believing
CTK was the only threat.

02:27:03.750 --> 02:27:05.291
Then, I found out about KTC.

02:27:06.750 --> 02:27:08.625
Dhanya thought only KTC existed.

02:27:10.166 --> 02:27:12.041
Before she could uncover CTK…

02:27:12.875 --> 02:27:13.833
She was killed.

02:27:13.958 --> 02:27:14.958
No, Mrudula.

02:27:15.083 --> 02:27:16.375
She sacrificed her life.

02:27:17.666 --> 02:27:18.666
Dhanya, cage number 8.

02:27:18.750 --> 02:27:20.458
Next one.
Cage number 3.

02:27:20.750 --> 02:27:21.875
Baby, cage number 3.

02:27:22.083 --> 02:27:24.958
When Alpha chose
cage number 3 for the first victim,

02:27:25.125 --> 02:27:29.583
she switched her cage number
and willingly became the first victim.

02:27:34.916 --> 02:27:35.916
Very brave!

02:27:38.208 --> 02:27:39.708
Dhanya is such a star, man.

02:27:39.958 --> 02:27:41.750
And a star must be celebrated.

02:27:43.291 --> 02:27:45.041
Her sacrifice must not be in vain.

02:27:45.458 --> 02:27:47.625
We have no part in this investigation.

02:27:48.625 --> 02:27:52.083
The world should never know about us.
And what happened in this mission.

02:27:55.750 --> 02:27:57.208
The one who led this mission,

02:27:57.833 --> 02:27:59.541
and saved those victims…

02:28:01.041 --> 02:28:01.875
was Dhanya.

02:28:08.375 --> 02:28:10.625
Guards, attention!

02:28:11.333 --> 02:28:14.541
Guards, general salute!

02:28:14.625 --> 02:28:16.541
Salami Shastra!

02:28:19.666 --> 02:28:22.833
Samuel has been in prison
for the past year, right?

02:28:23.208 --> 02:28:25.041
He's running everything from there.

02:28:26.666 --> 02:28:28.208
Unfortunately,

02:28:28.750 --> 02:28:33.208
his money and connections will
make prison feel like a luxury for him.

02:29:06.958 --> 02:29:09.708
What's your take on your son being jailed?

02:29:09.916 --> 02:29:12.000
My son? Jailed?

02:29:15.125 --> 02:29:16.291
Arjun Sarkaar?

02:29:31.583 --> 02:29:35.666
While probing the CTK website
on the dark web for the past year,

02:29:35.750 --> 02:29:40.833
she risked her life to infiltrate
their hideout in Arunachal Pradesh

02:29:40.916 --> 02:29:43.625
and eliminated 150 psychopaths.

02:29:43.750 --> 02:29:48.083
ACP Dhanya’s courage was praised
by police departments nationwide.

02:29:48.166 --> 02:29:52.375
Officers like Dhanya are a source
of great pride for our country.

02:29:52.458 --> 02:29:56.166
To pay tribute to Bose Bravery Awardee
ACP Dhanya,

02:29:56.250 --> 02:29:59.666
people of both states
have organized various programs.

02:30:00.416 --> 02:30:02.791
{\an8}-What did I say wrong?
-Sir, one second.

02:30:02.875 --> 02:30:03.791
{\an8}Please speak now.

02:30:03.875 --> 02:30:05.750
{\an8}What the hell is happening in our state?

02:30:05.916 --> 02:30:07.291
{\an8}What do the police think?

02:30:07.500 --> 02:30:10.916
{\an8}They slap cases on each other
and go to jail at will.

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.916
{\an8}A brawl happens to take place
in the same jail and kills a prisoner.

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:17.500
{\an8}They're now releasing the arrested
police officer due to a lack of evidence.

02:30:17.625 --> 02:30:19.375
{\an8}Aren't there any rules here?

02:30:20.333 --> 02:30:26.250
{\an8}If we don't question Arjun Sarkaar today,
they'll bring another one to us tomorrow!

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:32.916
If these three lions on my belt represent
justice, morality and righteousness,

02:30:33.375 --> 02:30:36.000
then that invisible
fourth lion, that's me.

02:30:59.416 --> 02:31:01.375
-Where are you coming from?
-Kurnool, sir.

02:31:04.083 --> 02:31:05.500
What's that you're carrying?

02:31:05.958 --> 02:31:06.791
Sir?

02:31:07.250 --> 02:31:08.500
What's the load?

02:31:08.750 --> 02:31:11.416
-Sand, sir.
-Hey, go and check.

02:31:14.416 --> 02:31:16.958
Sir is sitting there.
Go, talk to him.

02:31:22.791 --> 02:31:23.791
What's his name?

02:31:25.458 --> 02:31:26.833
ACP Veerappan.

02:31:27.125 --> 02:31:28.291
Veerappan.

02:31:32.166 --> 02:31:34.833
Bro! Bro, they'll lock us up
if they find the dead body.

02:31:35.291 --> 02:31:37.416
It's buried beneath six tons of sand.

02:31:37.791 --> 02:31:40.208
Do you think they've got the time
to search that deep?

02:31:40.291 --> 02:31:42.041
Talk softly. He'll hear us.

02:31:42.333 --> 02:31:44.708
Didn't you hear his name?
He's a Tamilian.

02:31:44.958 --> 02:31:46.000
He won't get it.

02:31:46.708 --> 02:31:51.208
"A country is not just its soil
but its people,"

02:31:51.416 --> 02:31:53.250
said Gurajada Apparao.

02:32:20.333 --> 02:32:25.625
And I say the country isn't just soil
but the people within it.

02:32:26.833 --> 02:32:28.125
Wow!

02:32:29.875 --> 02:32:31.625
Did you think I couldn't speak Telugu?

02:32:32.500 --> 02:32:34.250
I'm bilingual.

02:32:35.333 --> 02:32:37.333
Bro, hold the phone.

02:32:40.958 --> 02:32:42.125
Get the load off, guys!

02:32:56.750 --> 02:33:01.125
In each discourse, we've been hearing
about a different avatar.

02:33:01.250 --> 02:33:04.791
So far, you've heard
the stories of three avatars.

02:33:04.958 --> 02:33:08.875
We'll listen to the story of
the fourth avatar again tomorrow.

02:33:08.958 --> 02:33:12.125

May the auspiciousness prevail.
