SOKULAPALEM

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.541
Everyone's story starts with a mother.

00:01:10.083 --> 00:01:11.291
So does mine.

00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:14.250
Chinnu…

00:01:15.833 --> 00:01:17.916
Do you know what true anger means?

00:01:18.916 --> 00:01:21.458
PROLOGUE

00:01:28.875 --> 00:01:30.458
Hey, why are you being a baby?

00:01:33.625 --> 00:01:34.791
You heard the doctor.

00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:37.291
No matter what we do,

00:01:37.375 --> 00:01:39.666
I won't make it past two months.

00:01:41.291 --> 00:01:42.166
It is what it is.

00:01:43.541 --> 00:01:46.541
You've done beyond your potential.

00:01:48.083 --> 00:01:49.166
What more can you do?

00:01:50.583 --> 00:01:52.250
This is just my fate.

00:01:57.458 --> 00:01:59.666
Can I get through life without you?

00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.666
When I think of our kids…

00:02:05.833 --> 00:02:07.500
I get worried about their future.

00:02:11.541 --> 00:02:13.125
Don't tell them yet.

00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:20.916
First, let me tell them
how to take on life.

00:02:22.875 --> 00:02:25.000
We can tell them slowly later.

00:02:26.125 --> 00:02:28.083
Your son needs…

00:02:29.625 --> 00:02:31.750
most of the talking.

00:02:32.166 --> 00:02:33.791
He beat someone up again.

00:02:35.791 --> 00:02:37.333
If he repeats this…

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.416
they'll rusticate him from school.

00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:48.750
I wonder where all his anger comes from.

00:02:54.083 --> 00:02:55.166
Where else?

00:02:57.333 --> 00:03:00.000
If you're Chayadevi,
your son is Suryakantham.

00:03:01.708 --> 00:03:03.791
He's gone after his feisty mother.

00:03:06.291 --> 00:03:07.666
Hey!

00:03:08.875 --> 00:03:12.375
Hey, brother-in-law!
Send Chaya out!

00:03:13.541 --> 00:03:14.458
Seethapathi.

00:03:14.791 --> 00:03:15.750
My uncle.

00:03:16.333 --> 00:03:18.125
They're our only relatives.

00:03:19.166 --> 00:03:20.250
My aunt, Prabhavathi.

00:03:21.333 --> 00:03:22.333
And her daughter Kalyani.

00:03:23.375 --> 00:03:24.375
Kallu for short.

00:03:25.208 --> 00:03:26.125
My Kallu.

00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.583
She doesn't like me one bit.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.875
Reason being…

00:03:35.125 --> 00:03:36.083
my anger.

00:03:37.625 --> 00:03:38.541
Surya!

00:03:44.083 --> 00:03:46.125
He used to come home drunk
and beat up my aunt every day.

00:03:46.541 --> 00:03:49.875
So my mom made his wife file a
complaint against her own brother.

00:03:50.083 --> 00:03:51.291
She sent him to jail.

00:03:51.375 --> 00:03:53.291
I'll not spare you!

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.500
But she knew that wasn't the solution.

00:03:56.166 --> 00:03:57.500
So, without anyone's knowledge…

00:03:58.208 --> 00:04:00.000
she wanted to send them to another city.

00:04:01.375 --> 00:04:03.583
Kallu didn't say a word
to me before leaving.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.541
She didn't even give me a chance
to tell her how much I love her.

00:04:11.333 --> 00:04:13.666
-Come on out!
-You're creating a havoc every day!

00:04:14.375 --> 00:04:17.083
-You're enjoying with your spouse at home.
-What is it?

00:04:17.208 --> 00:04:20.416
I'm roaming on the streets like an orphan.

00:04:20.541 --> 00:04:21.958
You…
Answer me!

00:04:22.125 --> 00:04:23.916
Hey, mind your language!

00:04:24.208 --> 00:04:25.625
You went to jail and
you're still as barbaric.

00:04:25.708 --> 00:04:26.750
-Yes, I am!
-Hey!

00:04:26.875 --> 00:04:29.541
What's with this drama every day?
We're not able to sleep.

00:04:29.666 --> 00:04:31.541
She sent my wife and daughter away.

00:04:31.791 --> 00:04:33.333
Tell her to give me their address.

00:04:33.416 --> 00:04:35.916
Tell him where they are.
He'll take them home.

00:04:36.083 --> 00:04:38.541
-I don't know.
-Come on! He's your brother.

00:04:38.666 --> 00:04:39.625
He's not my brother.

00:04:40.083 --> 00:04:41.166
I don't have a brother.

00:04:41.291 --> 00:04:42.625
I have nothing to do with this man.

00:04:42.833 --> 00:04:45.291
I don't care if you hit him
or report him to the police.

00:04:45.375 --> 00:04:46.250
Come inside.

00:04:46.333 --> 00:04:47.750
-Do whatever the hell you want.
-You don't know me?

00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.875
-Get out of here!
-Let me go!

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.000
-Tell me where my wife and daughter are!
-Hey!

00:04:55.125 --> 00:04:56.708
Why do you want extra
trouble in this situation?

00:04:56.791 --> 00:04:58.083
Just tell him where they are.

00:04:58.166 --> 00:04:59.958
They're living safely and
independently. Let them.

00:05:00.291 --> 00:05:01.708
You saw what he does to them.

00:05:01.791 --> 00:05:03.250
I'll break his legs! Take him away!

00:05:04.125 --> 00:05:05.583
No, listen to me.

00:05:05.875 --> 00:05:08.833
No matter what anyone says,
I won't reveal their whereabouts.

00:05:09.041 --> 00:05:09.916
Not even to you.

00:05:11.208 --> 00:05:12.083
Where did he go?

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.833
Come.

00:05:31.791 --> 00:05:33.583
Come.

00:05:42.583 --> 00:05:44.375
Tired, already?

00:05:44.875 --> 00:05:45.791
Come.

00:06:06.041 --> 00:06:07.541
You can't just hit people
when you're angry.

00:06:08.625 --> 00:06:10.166
Is there no other way?

00:06:11.375 --> 00:06:12.666
That's the only way I know.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:14.125
Chinnu, look at me.

00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:16.583
If you lose your temper for everything,

00:06:16.916 --> 00:06:18.500
your anger will have no meaning.

00:06:19.125 --> 00:06:20.833
Your anger needs to have a purpose.

00:06:21.583 --> 00:06:22.666
A reason.

00:06:23.375 --> 00:06:24.291
Am I right?

00:06:24.583 --> 00:06:25.750
There is a reason, Mom.

00:06:25.833 --> 00:06:26.958
Uncle called you--

00:06:30.083 --> 00:06:31.375
Will you listen to your mom?

00:06:41.916 --> 00:06:42.916
Come.

00:06:44.875 --> 00:06:47.416
Let's dedicate a day to your anger.

00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:48.833
What do you mean?

00:06:49.541 --> 00:06:52.625
Well, you can't express
your anger every day.

00:06:53.125 --> 00:06:55.083
A dedicated day for your anger.

00:06:55.791 --> 00:06:57.250
One day a week.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.041
No matter how furious you are,

00:06:59.166 --> 00:07:01.125
you can express it only on that one day.

00:07:01.833 --> 00:07:04.125
Even if it gets tough on the other days,

00:07:04.208 --> 00:07:05.708
you should control your anger somehow.

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.125
Why so?

00:07:08.208 --> 00:07:11.916
Because more than half the instances
that make you angry are pointless.

00:07:12.708 --> 00:07:15.166
So whenever you feel angry,

00:07:15.375 --> 00:07:17.708
pause for a while, think about it,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.833
and if you still feel the
same anger towards them,

00:07:22.458 --> 00:07:24.625
you can express it on that one day.

00:07:25.166 --> 00:07:26.083
Okay?

00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:28.875
Promise me.

00:07:30.833 --> 00:07:32.166
I can express it on that one day, right?

00:07:38.583 --> 00:07:39.666
My sweetheart!

00:07:40.083 --> 00:07:41.125
Tell me which day that is.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.916
From now on,

00:07:45.291 --> 00:07:47.458
whenever you feel angry,

00:07:48.208 --> 00:07:49.666
you come to me and tell me.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.583
The day your anger is truly justified,

00:07:54.041 --> 00:07:55.500
I won't say a word.

00:08:00.666 --> 00:08:02.583
That day, you do what you want.

00:08:03.708 --> 00:08:04.625
Okay?

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:10.083
With the patience
And affection of an angel

00:08:10.166 --> 00:08:11.708
Just because you learned to cook,

00:08:11.791 --> 00:08:13.500
doesn't mean you live in the kitchen.

00:08:13.791 --> 00:08:17.125
This is just another subject like
the ones you have in school.

00:08:18.041 --> 00:08:18.958
Understood?

00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:21.125
Let me taste it.

00:08:22.875 --> 00:08:24.041
It's yummy.

00:08:25.166 --> 00:08:26.291
Mom, today?

00:08:26.625 --> 00:08:27.500
What happened?

00:08:27.583 --> 00:08:29.708
Rakesh spilled ink on my shirt.

00:08:30.375 --> 00:08:31.458
Tell me, is today the day?

00:08:31.541 --> 00:08:32.583
WEDNESDAY

00:08:32.666 --> 00:08:34.708
Wednesday is always a…

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.500
A journey of hope that goes on forever

00:08:40.583 --> 00:08:41.458
Mom, today?

00:08:43.125 --> 00:08:44.458
MONDAY

00:08:44.625 --> 00:08:46.166
If you strike off every day,

00:08:46.375 --> 00:08:48.083
how do I control my anger, Mom?

00:08:48.458 --> 00:08:50.958
You've been reading the
same lesson for four days.

00:08:51.875 --> 00:08:52.791
What lesson is it?

00:08:53.791 --> 00:08:54.708
Deepavali.

00:08:56.333 --> 00:08:57.375
I have an idea.

00:08:58.125 --> 00:09:00.500
"There lived a demon called
Narakasur in the olden days.

00:09:00.583 --> 00:09:01.833
He used to trouble people a lot.

00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:04.791
So, Sri Krishna teamed up
with Satyabhama and killed him."

00:09:05.041 --> 00:09:10.750
It's the beginning of a new spring

00:09:10.916 --> 00:09:17.375
Silence brings this sweet agony

00:09:17.458 --> 00:09:19.041
There lived a demon called
Narakasur in the olden days.

00:09:19.125 --> 00:09:20.333
He used to trouble people a lot.

00:09:20.416 --> 00:09:23.166
So Sri Krishna teamed up
with Satyabhama and killed him!

00:09:41.125 --> 00:09:42.625
What's with these stupid
scribbles on the wall?

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.833
Whack him a couple of times
and all his anger will come down.

00:09:47.375 --> 00:09:49.583
You can't expect change
without a seed of hope.

00:09:50.875 --> 00:09:54.791
You're only thinking about the one
day he's going to express his anger.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.750
I'm thinking about the six days
when he won't cross the line.

00:09:59.416 --> 00:10:00.666
I'm worried about him
exploding on that one day,

00:10:00.791 --> 00:10:02.458
after holding it in for so long.

00:10:03.125 --> 00:10:05.291
I don't get this
"angry one day a week" thing.

00:10:12.625 --> 00:10:13.583
Chinnu…

00:10:15.708 --> 00:10:16.583
Chinnu…

00:10:21.208 --> 00:10:23.333
Do you know what true anger means?

00:10:27.666 --> 00:10:28.666
Chinnu?

00:10:30.625 --> 00:10:31.750
I didn't listen to what
she said that night.

00:10:32.541 --> 00:10:34.541
And I didn't know that I
would never hear it again.

00:10:41.041 --> 00:10:41.916
Mom…

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.083
Mom, get up!

00:10:58.333 --> 00:11:00.583
She's dead!

00:11:02.125 --> 00:11:03.083
-Hey!
-Go away!

00:11:03.208 --> 00:11:05.750
Go away! Don't create a scene!

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.250
Get out of here!

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.958
Enough of your nuisance!

00:11:10.333 --> 00:11:12.333
I don't care really.

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:16.458
But where did you send
my wife and little girl?

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:19.583
You witch!

00:11:33.916 --> 00:11:35.208
Bloody witch, get up!

00:11:36.083 --> 00:11:37.041
Get up!

00:11:41.791 --> 00:11:43.541
Have you lost your mind?

00:11:43.625 --> 00:11:46.666
She's your sister, damn it!
When will you change?

00:12:05.708 --> 00:12:07.000
Mom, today?

00:12:09.583 --> 00:12:10.750
Mom, today?

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:13.875
FRIDAY

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.958
SATURDAY

00:12:18.083 --> 00:12:18.958
Mom…

00:12:20.208 --> 00:12:22.791
Transition…

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.666
Origin…

00:12:26.041 --> 00:12:29.000
Arrival…

00:12:29.416 --> 00:12:31.250
The day your anger is truly justified,

00:12:31.583 --> 00:12:32.750
I won't say a word.

00:12:33.458 --> 00:12:35.458
You do whatever you want.

00:12:35.541 --> 00:12:37.041
SATURDAY

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:38.125
Okay?

00:12:52.333 --> 00:12:55.833
He, the one who breaks
The shackles of doubt

00:12:55.916 --> 00:12:58.625
With a fierce and intense gaze

00:12:58.791 --> 00:13:01.583
His nails are like blazing
Flames on a mountain

00:13:01.708 --> 00:13:04.708
He is the constant force
Of balance on a Saturday

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.916
Of balance…

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:48.125
Usually, we feel happy
when kids listen to their parents.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:51.291
But my son has taken his
mom's word so seriously.

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:53.875
Sometimes, I don't know
whether to laugh or cry about it.

00:13:55.416 --> 00:13:58.083
Is he still doing the Saturday thing?

00:13:58.250 --> 00:13:59.333
He's not just following it.

00:13:59.583 --> 00:14:01.208
Like a lizard that grows into a chameleon,

00:14:01.291 --> 00:14:03.416
he's obsessed with the concept.

00:14:04.125 --> 00:14:05.916
From Sunday to Friday,

00:14:06.416 --> 00:14:08.916
he comes home without picking
a fight no matter how pissed he is.

00:14:09.416 --> 00:14:10.583
But before going to bed,

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:13.333
he writes in his diary
as if it's holy scripture.

00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.708
"Who?"
"What they have done?"

00:14:20.083 --> 00:14:21.541
He follows this religiously till Friday.

00:14:22.166 --> 00:14:24.250
-What about Saturday?
-Saturday!

00:14:25.208 --> 00:14:26.500
He wakes up in the morning.

00:14:26.875 --> 00:14:30.833
He introspects if he's still
angry at the people in his diary.

00:14:31.708 --> 00:14:33.375
If his anger has passed, it's all good.

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:35.125
He strikes off their names.

00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:36.833
And if he's still angry?

00:14:36.916 --> 00:14:38.791
He circles their names.

00:14:38.875 --> 00:14:40.041
NARAYANA PRABHA

00:14:40.291 --> 00:14:43.000
And once he circles a name…

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:46.333
he goes to any length to beat them up.

00:14:47.291 --> 00:14:48.625
He gets there one way or the other.

00:14:53.625 --> 00:14:55.916
Hello, bro. My boss is going out of town.

00:14:56.291 --> 00:14:57.458
He won't be back for another week.

00:14:58.125 --> 00:14:59.916
Hello? Are you there, bro?

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:02.125
Hello?

00:15:15.916 --> 00:15:18.375
You must've heard about
Yama and Chitragupta.

00:15:18.833 --> 00:15:21.375
Imagine if he's both,
a split personality.

00:15:32.875 --> 00:15:34.500
Where is he headed, looking like that?

00:15:34.833 --> 00:15:37.750
It's normal to get angry
when our family is bothered.

00:15:38.375 --> 00:15:40.458
But my son makes people his family,

00:15:40.916 --> 00:15:42.958
based on his anger.

00:15:43.333 --> 00:15:44.208
What do you mean?

00:15:46.791 --> 00:15:48.375
Fazil, did he hit you again?

00:15:48.666 --> 00:15:49.541
Yeah, bro.

00:15:49.625 --> 00:15:50.958
-How many stitches did you get?
-Six.

00:15:51.041 --> 00:15:55.208
Fazil, didn't I warn you about that man?

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:57.166
That stupid habit
of yours has led to this.

00:15:57.375 --> 00:15:58.708
-But you couldn't care less.
-Cut him some slack.

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.875
That man roughed him up so
badly and you're taking his side.

00:16:02.666 --> 00:16:04.041
Just be careful, man.

00:16:04.333 --> 00:16:05.791
Everyone shows sympathy.

00:16:05.875 --> 00:16:07.916
But nobody comes
forward to confront my boss.

00:16:11.666 --> 00:16:12.541
Who's your boss?

00:16:12.791 --> 00:16:13.708
Who are you, bro?

00:16:13.916 --> 00:16:14.791
I'll tell you.

00:16:18.041 --> 00:16:19.375
But first, who's your boss?

00:16:24.833 --> 00:16:27.208
Aren't you coming back, Kali uncle?

00:16:28.041 --> 00:16:29.625
Not if you keep crying like this.

00:16:30.083 --> 00:16:31.958
Stop crying and study well.

00:16:32.625 --> 00:16:33.583
I'll visit you soon.

00:16:34.541 --> 00:16:36.875
-Don't get intimidated by Grandpa.
-Okay.

00:16:37.458 --> 00:16:39.833
Call me if you need anything at all.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.541
You can also
call me if you need anything.

00:17:22.791 --> 00:17:24.166
What's up, Fazil?

00:17:25.708 --> 00:17:27.250
Hello, sir. I'm Surya.

00:17:27.541 --> 00:17:29.208
Are you expecting me to introduce myself?

00:17:29.291 --> 00:17:31.750
Not at all. Who doesn't
know Narayana Prabha?

00:17:32.583 --> 00:17:34.625
He told me you hit him because
he set the clock ten minutes ahead.

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.541
He could've lost his eye.

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:39.083
What do you propose we do?

00:17:39.458 --> 00:17:40.333
Simple, sir.

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:41.666
Every action has a reason.

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:44.500
I think it was unfair to hit him
without knowing the reason.

00:17:46.166 --> 00:17:47.458
If you listen to his reason…

00:17:48.625 --> 00:17:49.500
you'll see why he did it.

00:17:52.791 --> 00:17:53.708
-Bro…
-Tell him.

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:56.375
Speak out.

00:17:57.291 --> 00:17:58.500
Well, sir…

00:17:58.916 --> 00:18:01.958
My dad fell under
a running train and died.

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:04.333
Ever since then,
my mom would always say…

00:18:04.666 --> 00:18:06.458
"I wish your father was ten
minutes early to the station.

00:18:06.833 --> 00:18:08.625
Our lives would've been different."

00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:11.583
That is why every time I see a clock,

00:18:11.791 --> 00:18:13.333
I feel like setting it ten minutes ahead.

00:18:13.791 --> 00:18:16.000
-I don't want anyone else to lose--
-You heard him.

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:18.958
Let's not get into whether
his habit is right or wrong.

00:18:19.291 --> 00:18:21.791
But if his habit comes
from a good intention,

00:18:22.041 --> 00:18:22.916
we should support him.

00:18:23.875 --> 00:18:24.791
What do you have to say?

00:18:24.916 --> 00:18:26.541
I have nothing to say.

00:18:27.416 --> 00:18:29.458
-How is he related to you though?
-We're not related, sir.

00:18:30.416 --> 00:18:31.291
No relation whatsoever.

00:18:32.458 --> 00:18:33.541
But after listening to his story…

00:18:34.541 --> 00:18:35.500
I got angry.

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:40.708
And once I get angry…

00:18:41.708 --> 00:18:42.791
he becomes my family.

00:18:43.333 --> 00:18:44.250
His problem becomes mine.

00:18:49.375 --> 00:18:51.250
He won't work for you if
you're going to hit him again.

00:18:51.791 --> 00:18:53.250
Promise me you won't.

00:18:53.833 --> 00:18:56.083
I'll apologize to the kid first…

00:18:56.583 --> 00:18:58.458
and then deal with your anger.

00:18:59.833 --> 00:19:00.916
No apologies needed, sir.

00:19:03.333 --> 00:19:04.416
-Sir!
-You expect me to apologize,

00:19:04.666 --> 00:19:06.666
you little scum!

00:19:09.375 --> 00:19:12.041
Was that a warning?

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:14.833
"There was a demon called
Narakasur in the olden days.

00:19:14.916 --> 00:19:16.041
He used to trouble people a lot.

00:19:16.166 --> 00:19:20.208
I arrived ten minutes early to a
meeting and everyone called me jobless.

00:19:20.625 --> 00:19:23.083
You didn't just do a shitty job…

00:19:23.375 --> 00:19:26.500
but you gave me
an even shittier reason.

00:19:26.583 --> 00:19:28.291
Don't even get me started on this bugger.

00:19:33.208 --> 00:19:35.000
What are you chanting in Hindi?

00:19:35.083 --> 00:19:36.000
What are you going to do?

00:19:36.291 --> 00:19:37.166
Hey!

00:19:38.208 --> 00:19:40.708
If you don't quit that habit of yours…

00:19:40.791 --> 00:19:41.708
I'll whack you again.

00:19:42.375 --> 00:19:44.625
And this time, I'll make
sure you lose your eye.

00:19:46.583 --> 00:19:48.541
You'll lose an eye as well,
for taking his side.

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:50.875
You understand?

00:19:52.583 --> 00:19:53.583
Get lost!

00:19:54.125 --> 00:19:57.375
Hey, get him stitched up again
and send him back to work.

00:19:58.083 --> 00:19:59.041
Who the hell are you, bro?

00:19:59.583 --> 00:20:01.250
You dragged me all the way for this?

00:20:05.791 --> 00:20:06.708
Just like you…

00:20:08.333 --> 00:20:09.541
I have a habit as well.

00:20:28.666 --> 00:20:30.791
I didn't know he could fight, man.

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:38.250
In your eyes, in front of you
He'll show fear!

00:20:38.583 --> 00:20:43.833
Not one, not two
In the list of eight, he's burst out!

00:20:44.083 --> 00:20:48.916
All in all, the one playing
Is like a butterfly!

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:54.375
Even if he's caught, he won't show
He keeps it in his mound!

00:20:54.541 --> 00:20:58.375
Guys, the angry bird came
with a half-shaved face.

00:20:58.791 --> 00:21:00.833
Shave the rest and send him home.

00:21:00.958 --> 00:21:06.125
On the enemy's head slate
He writes fate!

00:21:11.083 --> 00:21:15.916
Fist by fist, it's Yama
If you smile, it's Shiva

00:21:16.875 --> 00:21:21.250
Heart by heart, it's iron
Body of an elephant

00:21:22.458 --> 00:21:27.500
Whoever the enemy
If he comes, he bleeds

00:21:27.916 --> 00:21:33.041
Face of fire and water
He's a different breed

00:22:14.666 --> 00:22:16.208
Fazil won't work for you anymore.

00:22:18.291 --> 00:22:19.166
Thanks, bro.

00:22:19.333 --> 00:22:20.208
Goodbye, sir.

00:22:22.875 --> 00:22:23.750
Goodbye.

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:29.708
Get this stitched up.

00:22:31.541 --> 00:22:34.458
Hey, I don't understand.

00:22:35.041 --> 00:22:36.666
Why didn't you hit me that day?

00:22:37.375 --> 00:22:38.666
And why did you hit me today?

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:42.208
What? Did I hit a nerve?

00:22:42.625 --> 00:22:43.875
Everyone has seven days in a week.

00:22:47.416 --> 00:22:48.625
But I have only one.

00:22:49.666 --> 00:22:50.666
Only one day.

00:22:52.583 --> 00:22:53.458
Saturday.

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:56.458
Why?

00:22:57.291 --> 00:22:58.291
Isn't that enough?

00:22:59.125 --> 00:23:04.416
As Brahma, as Narasimha
He'll create a new world, watch!

00:23:04.666 --> 00:23:10.000
As Buddha, as a great warrior
Will transform into a fierce tiger

00:23:10.208 --> 00:23:15.208
To touch or to leave
He'll say instantly, that person

00:23:15.291 --> 00:23:21.333
On Saturday he'll fight the enemy
On other days, like a sage!

00:23:22.083 --> 00:23:24.041
So, your son is rowdy?

00:23:24.333 --> 00:23:25.833
Hey, not at all.

00:23:26.291 --> 00:23:27.166
Then?

00:24:02.375 --> 00:24:04.000
Mention that his leg
was broken as well, sir.

00:24:04.083 --> 00:24:05.625
It will help them when they're on a break.

00:24:05.708 --> 00:24:07.708
-Why don't you do it?
-No, sir. It's your job.

00:24:09.291 --> 00:24:11.000
You always have some shit to say.

00:24:12.875 --> 00:24:15.250
To wish for your family's wellness
for as long as you live is selfishness.

00:24:15.916 --> 00:24:18.166
But to wish for your family's
wellness even while you're gone is…

00:24:18.541 --> 00:24:19.500
responsibility.

00:24:21.541 --> 00:24:22.875
This is our life insurance.

00:24:23.166 --> 00:24:24.250
That is Surya!

00:24:24.583 --> 00:24:26.375
Since our 25th anniversary is coming up…

00:24:26.833 --> 00:24:30.500
I'm giving Surya the responsibility
of picking the Chief Guest.

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:31.791
Claps, guys.

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:35.000
When a guy with such a
peculiar lifestyle lives in the house…

00:24:35.583 --> 00:24:38.500
imagine how peculiar
our lifestyle must be.

00:24:42.416 --> 00:24:43.291
Hey!

00:24:49.458 --> 00:24:50.500
There was a demon--

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:57.250
-I'm Santhosh.
-He's here, brother.

00:24:57.958 --> 00:24:59.083
Bhadra, we have to go.

00:24:59.375 --> 00:25:00.416
What's wrong, Surya?

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:01.458
-Let's go.
-Surya!

00:25:01.625 --> 00:25:03.291
-Surya!
-Just get on the damn bike.

00:25:04.791 --> 00:25:05.666
Leave the car behind.

00:25:05.791 --> 00:25:07.166
Come fast. Run.

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:09.125
Hey, get back here!

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:10.583
Hey!

00:25:13.458 --> 00:25:15.333
There lived a demon called
Narsapur in the olden days.

00:25:15.625 --> 00:25:16.583
It's not Narsapur.

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:18.375
It's Narakasur.

00:25:18.458 --> 00:25:19.458
There lived a demon!

00:25:45.625 --> 00:25:46.500
Why did he spare him?

00:25:47.708 --> 00:25:48.791
The clock struck 12.

00:25:49.041 --> 00:25:52.000
-So he won't hit him till next Saturday?
-No.

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:53.916
He'll never hit him again.

00:25:54.166 --> 00:25:56.916
There's another stupid
rule in his rulebook.

00:25:57.333 --> 00:26:01.166
If he can't hit a certain
person by that Saturday,

00:26:01.625 --> 00:26:03.583
he believes his mom
doesn't want him to hit them.

00:26:03.666 --> 00:26:05.833
So he spares them
forever in his mom's name.

00:26:06.333 --> 00:26:08.000
He even made friends out of this.

00:26:09.166 --> 00:26:10.083
Hey!

00:26:10.625 --> 00:26:13.750
Thank you for sparing my grandpa.

00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:16.125
Happy New Year.

00:26:16.458 --> 00:26:17.583
Happy New Year.

00:26:18.083 --> 00:26:20.666
I thought at least marriage would fix him.

00:26:22.208 --> 00:26:25.208
Hey, there was this girl, right?
What's her name?

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.500
Kallu. Did you guys find her?

00:26:30.083 --> 00:26:33.125
We moved multiple times due to this guy.
So we completely lost touch.

00:26:33.875 --> 00:26:35.041
Bu,t he…

00:26:37.583 --> 00:26:38.875
-Your name?
-Kalyani.

00:26:41.375 --> 00:26:42.541
Is your mom's name Prabhavathi?

00:26:43.416 --> 00:26:44.333
Which Prabhavathi?

00:26:44.416 --> 00:26:46.000
Who the hell are you,
calling at this hour?

00:26:46.083 --> 00:26:49.375
Nothing. No. No. We're calling
from the Election Commission.

00:26:50.583 --> 00:26:51.708
We don't know where they live now.

00:26:52.166 --> 00:26:54.375
Even if we do, she hates you.

00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:56.500
She wouldn't even step inside
the house when you were around.

00:26:56.833 --> 00:26:57.708
That was back then.

00:26:57.791 --> 00:26:59.541
I'm a changed man. She'll
also change when she finds out.

00:26:59.625 --> 00:27:02.666
This is not the film Mayabazar where
everyone changes instantaneously.

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:05.500
Moreover, it's not enough if
you declare that you've changed.

00:27:05.625 --> 00:27:07.708
What if she's married by now?

00:27:07.791 --> 00:27:08.791
-Exactly!
-Hey!

00:27:08.875 --> 00:27:09.875
Why do you manifest negative things?

00:27:10.833 --> 00:27:12.916
Y'all may not know how much I love her.

00:27:14.208 --> 00:27:15.083
But my aunt knows.

00:27:16.375 --> 00:27:17.291
She would never let her get married.

00:27:22.708 --> 00:27:23.708
I expected this.

00:27:24.666 --> 00:27:27.041
He has a fixated mindset.

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:29.500
Once he sets his mind
to something, that's it.

00:27:29.875 --> 00:27:32.416
That is why we did what we had to.

00:27:33.333 --> 00:27:35.083
They say remove a thorn with a thorn.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:36.916
But what about Kallu?

00:27:38.708 --> 00:27:40.916
It's been four years
since Mom left us, Surya.

00:27:42.541 --> 00:27:45.291
She remembered you even in her last days.

00:27:45.666 --> 00:27:46.750
That's true.

00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:49.083
Apparently, they searched for us

00:27:49.375 --> 00:27:51.125
to invite us to her wedding.

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:52.916
But we moved so much, you know.

00:27:53.958 --> 00:27:55.208
We're living in Mumbai now, Surya.

00:27:56.125 --> 00:27:58.625
My husband got a job in the US recently.

00:27:59.166 --> 00:28:01.750
We came to Hyderabad
for some visa work.

00:28:02.625 --> 00:28:03.541
I was at the bank…

00:28:03.625 --> 00:28:07.416
when I heard a sweet
voice say "Uncle" from behind.

00:28:07.666 --> 00:28:11.375
Initially, I was surprised
to see who it was.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.750
I couldn't believe that
Kallu was all grown up now.

00:28:15.166 --> 00:28:16.166
This is my husband, Surya.

00:28:20.166 --> 00:28:21.333
He's your brother by relation.

00:28:27.791 --> 00:28:29.625
He belongs in the 60s or 70s.

00:28:29.708 --> 00:28:31.875
He's so old fashioned, I forget
who's the father and who's the son.

00:28:37.958 --> 00:28:38.958
Surya!

00:28:39.458 --> 00:28:40.458
Surya!

00:28:40.833 --> 00:28:42.125
Surya, don't cry.

00:28:42.416 --> 00:28:43.375
Listen to me.

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:45.083
-What's this?
-It's a ring.

00:28:45.833 --> 00:28:46.750
When did you buy it?

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:48.375
First salary.

00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:51.916
-How much was it?
-Go away!

00:28:53.541 --> 00:28:55.041
It's okay, Surya.

00:28:55.833 --> 00:28:57.583
Oh, my dear.

00:28:57.666 --> 00:28:58.541
Why are you crying?

00:28:59.125 --> 00:29:00.333
I can see you and your mom are happy.

00:29:03.958 --> 00:29:05.541
Oh, no! Poor boy!

00:29:05.625 --> 00:29:08.041
He's not so noble that
you feel sympathy for him.

00:29:08.458 --> 00:29:10.750
You wouldn't say that if you heard
what he did at his sister's wedding.

00:29:11.958 --> 00:29:13.541
There was a disagreement
regarding the bride's saree.

00:29:13.958 --> 00:29:15.666
Bhadra wanted to wear her mom's saree.

00:29:15.958 --> 00:29:18.208
We need to compromise
on a few things in a love marriage.

00:29:18.666 --> 00:29:21.166
They wanted her to wear the saree
that was offered to the Goddess.

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:22.958
Don't you think
we have our own sentiments?

00:29:24.166 --> 00:29:26.250
My daughter's stubbornness won in the end.

00:29:31.583 --> 00:29:33.333
Before things calmed down,

00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:34.708
something ugly was said.

00:29:34.791 --> 00:29:36.583
-Don't get on my nerves.
-Listen to me, brother.

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:39.125
Should we back down because
of a random floozy who's no more?

00:29:39.375 --> 00:29:41.875
-To hell with you guys!
-Somebody might hear you.

00:29:41.958 --> 00:29:43.458
I don't care. I'm not afraid.

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:45.375
He shouldn't have said that.

00:29:46.416 --> 00:29:47.708
I'm equally pissed.

00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:50.916
I'll handle him. I'll go talk to him.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000
Hey! Stop with the mumbling.

00:29:53.541 --> 00:29:54.416
Listen.

00:29:54.583 --> 00:29:55.875
If you do anything right now,

00:29:56.416 --> 00:29:58.166
she's going to pay for it later on.

00:29:59.125 --> 00:30:00.083
Keep that in mind.

00:30:09.791 --> 00:30:11.208
We assumed we had convinced him.

00:30:11.666 --> 00:30:13.791
But we could only control him
till the wedding was over…

00:30:15.166 --> 00:30:16.833
That's what we realized
once the clock struck 12.

00:30:22.625 --> 00:30:23.916
Surya, stop!

00:30:24.083 --> 00:30:25.291
Listen to me.

00:30:25.375 --> 00:30:26.958
-Surya, I said stop!
-How dare you hit me!

00:30:27.041 --> 00:30:28.333
Don't you have respect for the elders?

00:30:28.416 --> 00:30:29.791
I'm going to teach you a lesson.

00:30:29.875 --> 00:30:32.000
I'm the groom's father,
for heaven's sake.

00:30:32.083 --> 00:30:34.500
-Are you out of your mind, Surya?
-Hit him.

00:30:34.583 --> 00:30:37.166
Please stop, Surya. I'm begging you.

00:30:38.291 --> 00:30:39.166
Surya!

00:30:40.458 --> 00:30:42.291
We discussed this before
going ahead with the marriage.

00:30:44.625 --> 00:30:45.500
Look at him.

00:30:46.291 --> 00:30:49.125
Why does Dad have to
beg them for forgiveness?

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.375
Can't you see his pain?

00:30:52.791 --> 00:30:54.958
How can I live with
that family after this?

00:30:55.541 --> 00:30:56.791
Imagine how they'll treat me.

00:30:58.333 --> 00:31:00.000
So, you don't really care about us.

00:31:00.583 --> 00:31:02.500
You just want to
get your way all the time.

00:31:03.333 --> 00:31:04.458
I've had enough.

00:31:05.333 --> 00:31:08.208
I'm so fed up of trying
to change your ways.

00:31:09.458 --> 00:31:10.875
Do whatever the hell you want!

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.750
I won't be a part of your life anymore.

00:31:15.375 --> 00:31:16.666
And I expect the same from you.

00:31:17.583 --> 00:31:18.500
Sister…

00:31:18.791 --> 00:31:20.500
Please don't say that.

00:31:21.208 --> 00:31:22.208
Sorry.

00:31:23.208 --> 00:31:25.333
-I'll go apologize to them as well.
-No need.

00:31:25.583 --> 00:31:26.708
Just let me go.

00:31:28.416 --> 00:31:29.458
I said let go!

00:31:30.541 --> 00:31:31.958
Surya, you know me.

00:31:33.041 --> 00:31:35.583
I'll do something regretful
if you don't let me go.

00:31:43.708 --> 00:31:45.458
She's my only daughter.

00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:48.333
I couldn't even give her
a proper send-off.

00:31:50.958 --> 00:31:52.833
My son-in-law is a good man.

00:31:53.375 --> 00:31:54.750
He stood by her.

00:31:55.541 --> 00:31:56.875
Because of this foolish man,

00:31:57.625 --> 00:32:00.375
she doesn't have a maternal
or a paternal home now.

00:32:01.125 --> 00:32:03.375
Imagine how I must be feeling.
I'd be fuming with rage.

00:32:04.708 --> 00:32:08.083
That is why I went out of my way
and decided something.

00:32:08.541 --> 00:32:10.250
Every Saturday,

00:32:10.625 --> 00:32:16.333
I made it my duty to find his targets
at any cost and save them.

00:32:16.625 --> 00:32:18.416
He doesn't hit them once
that Saturday passes.

00:32:21.708 --> 00:32:24.000
In fact, that is why I came to see you.

00:32:25.416 --> 00:32:27.333
I'm sorry, I don't get it.

00:32:28.083 --> 00:32:30.375
The second name on my son's list
for this Saturday is…

00:32:30.916 --> 00:32:31.916
Teertham Gunasekhar.

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:33.458
That's your husband, right?

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000
He's not in the city.

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:45.083
He said he'd be back in two days
since he had a fever.

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:46.666
You have a temperature of 102 degrees.

00:32:51.333 --> 00:32:52.208
Drink this.

00:32:53.416 --> 00:32:54.458
Go to sleep.

00:32:54.791 --> 00:32:55.666
Now!

00:32:56.416 --> 00:32:58.125
I don't know what your husband has done.

00:32:59.166 --> 00:33:00.750
He works at the same
school as my daughter.

00:33:16.333 --> 00:33:17.250
Are you okay?

00:33:19.791 --> 00:33:21.166
Hey, Bhadra ma'am. Just a minute.

00:33:21.375 --> 00:33:23.416
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:33:23.583 --> 00:33:25.541
If you report this and the news gets out,

00:33:26.125 --> 00:33:28.125
she will suffer the
consequences more than me.

00:33:28.583 --> 00:33:29.625
See you.

00:33:37.166 --> 00:33:38.041
Damn…

00:33:48.333 --> 00:33:49.875
Time to wake up.

00:34:16.208 --> 00:34:18.500
THE TURN

00:34:18.583 --> 00:34:20.750
YOUR SAFETY IS OUR PRIORITY

00:34:33.291 --> 00:34:34.333
Sir.

00:34:37.625 --> 00:34:38.500
Sir.

00:34:42.208 --> 00:34:43.250
New joinee.

00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:46.250
Charulatha.

00:34:47.333 --> 00:34:49.125
-Joining today?
-Yes, sir.

00:34:49.791 --> 00:34:51.291
Show this to the CI once he's here.

00:34:51.708 --> 00:34:52.625
Take this.

00:34:59.458 --> 00:35:01.583
-Sir, the CI…
-He will be coming.

00:35:02.375 --> 00:35:03.416
Eat your food.

00:35:08.791 --> 00:35:11.166
Waiting for the CI, right?

00:35:12.291 --> 00:35:15.250
I see that you're eager to join duty.

00:35:15.916 --> 00:35:17.375
This is how it is at first.

00:35:17.958 --> 00:35:19.583
But once you meet him,

00:35:20.291 --> 00:35:22.083
you'll never ask to see him again.

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:25.333
That's how our CI is.

00:35:26.875 --> 00:35:27.958
Dayanand.

00:36:04.875 --> 00:36:06.000
-Sudha…
-Sir.

00:36:06.458 --> 00:36:10.041
The car is stinking despite
trying so many perfumes.

00:36:10.458 --> 00:36:11.333
Yes, sir.

00:36:11.416 --> 00:36:14.375
-We should find a new perfume.
-Sir.

00:36:15.916 --> 00:36:16.958
Do you know any?

00:36:18.625 --> 00:36:20.125
Good perfumes.

00:36:22.666 --> 00:36:24.500
-Did you send his video?
-Sir?

00:36:25.166 --> 00:36:27.833
-Did you send his video or not?
-Yes, I did, sir.

00:36:27.958 --> 00:36:29.708
I called him as well.
But no response.

00:36:30.708 --> 00:36:32.583
I wonder what's keeping him so busy.

00:36:33.333 --> 00:36:35.916
What the hell is he up to?

00:36:36.416 --> 00:36:37.291
Speak up.

00:36:37.416 --> 00:36:39.500
Who the hell sent you?

00:36:39.583 --> 00:36:41.791
-I didn't stab him.
-Who sent you?

00:36:41.958 --> 00:36:43.416
-I'm telling the truth.
-Spit it out.

00:36:44.083 --> 00:36:45.000
I said, speak out!

00:36:45.083 --> 00:36:45.958
Who the hell sent you, damn it?

00:36:46.041 --> 00:36:48.791
-I really don't know anything.
-Who sent you, man?

00:36:48.875 --> 00:36:50.375
-Do you want to tell us or die?
-Believe me, bro.

00:36:50.458 --> 00:36:52.166
-You bloody bugger! Tell us!
-Hey, stop!

00:36:52.333 --> 00:36:53.708
Stop it! Cut the drama!

00:36:53.958 --> 00:36:55.083
Just stop!

00:36:56.875 --> 00:37:00.000
Why did you want to kill me?

00:37:00.666 --> 00:37:02.791
-Has the video downloaded?
-Network is slow here, bro.

00:37:02.875 --> 00:37:03.958
Go outside and do it.

00:37:04.041 --> 00:37:05.375
-What are you standing here for? Get out.
-Okay.

00:37:12.083 --> 00:37:14.666
Do you know how it feels
to have a threat to your life?

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:15.833
It wasn't me, sir.

00:37:15.916 --> 00:37:18.208
You can't sleep, relax,
or, do anything at all, in fact.

00:37:18.416 --> 00:37:20.791
You're always looking out
for an attack on you.

00:37:20.916 --> 00:37:24.291
Your heart keeps pounding
in your ears out of fear.

00:37:24.375 --> 00:37:26.083
You can't focus on anything else.
You go crazy.

00:37:26.166 --> 00:37:27.125
Just like I am right now.

00:37:27.208 --> 00:37:28.083
Tell me.

00:37:28.875 --> 00:37:30.333
Why did you stab me at the airport?

00:37:30.541 --> 00:37:32.541
-Tell me!
-Sir, I swear I'm innocent.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.041
Some other guy was trying to stab you.

00:37:35.458 --> 00:37:36.708
I intervened to stop him.

00:37:36.791 --> 00:37:38.291
Do I look like a fool to you?

00:37:39.166 --> 00:37:40.458
Am I looking like a fricking fool?

00:37:40.666 --> 00:37:42.708
-I really don't know, sir.
-Okay, no problem.

00:37:46.875 --> 00:37:48.000
-Are you going to spit it out now?
-Brother!

00:37:48.083 --> 00:37:50.041
-I'm really innocent, sir.
-Yeah, right. You're a good boy.

00:37:50.125 --> 00:37:51.208
Bro, he's right.

00:37:51.625 --> 00:37:52.541
Hey, quiet!

00:37:53.666 --> 00:37:55.083
He's not the one who attempted murder.

00:37:55.458 --> 00:37:56.583
He just grabbed the knife from him.

00:37:57.375 --> 00:37:59.166
In fact, he's the one who saved you.

00:37:59.708 --> 00:38:01.833
Couldn't you come a bit early, you moron?

00:38:01.958 --> 00:38:03.750
He has lost half a liter of blood already.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.041
And a finger.

00:38:05.541 --> 00:38:08.916
Bro, bro, bro… I'm sorry.
Please don't mind.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.458
I have a judgment issue due to this eye.

00:38:11.625 --> 00:38:13.375
I can't see things clearly.

00:38:13.458 --> 00:38:14.583
Hence the lapse in judgment.

00:38:15.291 --> 00:38:18.458
What are you guys looking at?
Rush him to the hospital.

00:38:18.958 --> 00:38:19.916
Go, go, go.

00:38:20.125 --> 00:38:21.083
Don't worry.

00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:29.875
Why is my judgment
so off all the time, man?

00:38:30.041 --> 00:38:32.625
Wrong judgment every fricking time!

00:38:36.583 --> 00:38:37.541
Where's Govardhan?

00:38:38.208 --> 00:38:39.083
Please, sir.

00:38:39.916 --> 00:38:40.916
I have two kids.

00:38:44.625 --> 00:38:46.541
Oh, two kids!

00:38:47.791 --> 00:38:49.125
A girl and a boy?

00:38:49.625 --> 00:38:50.666
Both boys.

00:38:52.041 --> 00:38:53.166
Wow, two boys!

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:55.000
You must have been elated.

00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:56.541
Who's your favorite?

00:38:56.958 --> 00:38:58.000
The elder one or the younger one?

00:38:58.208 --> 00:39:00.791
Nothing like that, sir.
I love them equally.

00:39:00.875 --> 00:39:03.416
If you give me such soap opera bullshit,

00:39:03.541 --> 00:39:04.708
I'll put a bullet in your head.

00:39:05.666 --> 00:39:06.625
Be honest.

00:39:08.166 --> 00:39:10.083
The elder one or the younger one?

00:39:10.208 --> 00:39:12.708
I love my younger one a little more, sir.

00:39:13.916 --> 00:39:14.791
I knew it.

00:39:15.791 --> 00:39:21.333
Because you became the father
of two sons after he was born.

00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:22.708
Am I right?

00:39:23.583 --> 00:39:24.583
I guess so, sir.

00:39:25.041 --> 00:39:26.083
Hey, idiot!

00:39:26.916 --> 00:39:29.750
You became a father in the first
place because of the elder son.

00:39:30.208 --> 00:39:33.458
By that logic, he should be your favorite.

00:39:35.291 --> 00:39:36.333
You don't get it.

00:39:36.791 --> 00:39:40.333
You think nobody knows that you
love your younger son a little more.

00:39:41.125 --> 00:39:44.583
But your elder son
is watching from a corner.

00:39:44.708 --> 00:39:47.625
He's furious on the inside.

00:39:47.791 --> 00:39:48.750
But on who?

00:39:49.291 --> 00:39:50.208
Me.

00:39:50.333 --> 00:39:51.250
No, you idiot.

00:39:51.791 --> 00:39:53.333
Why would he be furious at you?

00:39:53.708 --> 00:39:55.166
He's furious at your younger son.

00:39:55.583 --> 00:39:58.708
If all this anger builds up…
And say, you die tomorrow,

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.833
what if the elder one betrays his younger
brother while splitting the assets?

00:40:02.458 --> 00:40:03.375
What will you do?

00:40:03.625 --> 00:40:05.208
With the wealth inherited from you

00:40:05.291 --> 00:40:07.458
and the wealth looted
from his younger brother,

00:40:07.541 --> 00:40:10.083
your elder son will own
three times the money.

00:40:10.416 --> 00:40:13.000
He will go on to become
a Corporator and then an MLA.

00:40:14.666 --> 00:40:18.375
But your younger son
will be working a modest CI job,

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.625
with a salary that does him no good,

00:40:21.333 --> 00:40:25.833
and a hopeless ambition to grow
as big as his elder brother.

00:40:26.125 --> 00:40:30.625
In an attempt to save the only
piece of land he owns now,

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.833
he kidnaps his brother's
auditor and Benami,

00:40:35.250 --> 00:40:37.541
assuming that he's a very important man.

00:40:37.625 --> 00:40:41.208
Only to find out that
he's a loser like you.

00:40:43.583 --> 00:40:44.708
Now the elder son
doesn't answer his calls.

00:40:46.291 --> 00:40:47.166
See?

00:40:47.833 --> 00:40:50.291
Your favoritism led to so many troubles.

00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:54.625
Such a waste!

00:40:54.875 --> 00:40:55.958
-Sudha.
-Sir.

00:40:57.291 --> 00:40:58.166
Let him go.

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:01.375
But why, sir?

00:41:01.875 --> 00:41:04.250
What else can we do, Sudha?

00:41:04.875 --> 00:41:05.916
He's a waste piece.

00:41:06.458 --> 00:41:07.875
Like tissue paper.

00:41:08.458 --> 00:41:10.041
If he were so important…

00:41:10.958 --> 00:41:12.708
my brother would've
called immediately and said,

00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:16.416
"If you hurt Govardhan,
I'll not spare you.

00:41:16.583 --> 00:41:19.458
You want my signature
on the land papers, right?

00:41:19.583 --> 00:41:21.541
You can have it. Send the papers over."

00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:23.291
That's what would've happened.

00:41:25.083 --> 00:41:25.958
Tissue paper.

00:41:26.541 --> 00:41:27.416
Let him go.

00:41:51.541 --> 00:41:53.000
Hello! Hey, hey!

00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:54.416
Let Govardhan go!

00:41:54.875 --> 00:41:56.333
I'll not spare you if you hurt him.

00:41:56.625 --> 00:41:59.333
You want my signature, right?
Send the papers over.

00:42:00.458 --> 00:42:03.125
But if you don't let him go
as soon as I sign the papers…

00:42:05.583 --> 00:42:06.833
Hey! Hey!

00:42:07.375 --> 00:42:08.708
Sudha! Sudha!

00:42:08.958 --> 00:42:11.916
-Catch him! He's highly important!
-What's wrong, sir?

00:42:12.250 --> 00:42:13.875
-Govardhan!
-He left, sir.

00:42:17.541 --> 00:42:18.916
He's not a waste piece, Sudha.

00:42:19.583 --> 00:42:22.750
I'm the loser here.

00:42:22.916 --> 00:42:23.833
What happened, sir?

00:42:23.916 --> 00:42:25.208
-My brother called.
-Sir?!

00:42:25.291 --> 00:42:27.041
I have to do something.

00:42:27.208 --> 00:42:29.291
I let the opportunity slip.

00:42:29.375 --> 00:42:30.625
I have to do something.

00:42:30.958 --> 00:42:34.291
I just let 45 crores go.

00:42:34.375 --> 00:42:36.500
-I have to do something.
-Should I start the car?

00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:41.041
SOKULAPALEM

00:42:57.208 --> 00:42:58.708
I don't think he's coming today.

00:42:59.125 --> 00:43:00.666
Listen to me, go home.

00:43:00.791 --> 00:43:01.666
Hey!

00:43:02.208 --> 00:43:03.083
-Hey!
-Sir…

00:43:03.416 --> 00:43:05.083
I guess you just got lucky.

00:43:05.791 --> 00:43:06.708
There he is.

00:43:08.625 --> 00:43:10.208
Sir, I'm begging you!
Please let me go!

00:43:10.291 --> 00:43:11.208
Hey!

00:43:15.041 --> 00:43:16.541
Sir, I'm begging you!
Please let me go!

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:19.375
What did he do to deserve
such a brash beating, sir?

00:43:19.583 --> 00:43:22.541
Have you heard of the famous Stuartpuram?

00:43:24.541 --> 00:43:26.583
Similarly, here we have Sokulapalem.

00:43:26.916 --> 00:43:29.125
Being born there is their biggest mistake.

00:43:29.708 --> 00:43:32.583
Some people vent their anger
on their wives and kids.

00:43:32.958 --> 00:43:34.458
Some people vent it on things.

00:43:35.208 --> 00:43:36.083
Poor guy!

00:43:36.333 --> 00:43:37.833
He doesn't have a wife or kids.

00:43:38.583 --> 00:43:39.916
And the only things in hand are…

00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:41.791
the people of Sokulapalem.

00:43:47.541 --> 00:43:49.041
Hey!

00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:04.375
Chinnu…

00:44:04.833 --> 00:44:06.833
Do you know what true anger means?

00:44:08.875 --> 00:44:09.750
Chinnu…

00:44:19.791 --> 00:44:21.208
Dad… Dad…

00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:22.583
What is it?

00:44:23.083 --> 00:44:24.541
Is it the true anger dream again?

00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:27.208
What do you think Mom tried to tell me?

00:44:27.333 --> 00:44:29.333
To heck with you, man!

00:44:29.833 --> 00:44:31.208
You're giving me hell.

00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:33.250
Hand me that book.

00:44:34.416 --> 00:44:37.916
I noted this down from a sermon
by Nithyananda.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.208
He says…

00:44:39.541 --> 00:44:40.583
"Truth is anger.

00:44:40.875 --> 00:44:42.208
And the anger is truth.

00:44:42.458 --> 00:44:45.750
But the actual anger
resides in actual truth…

00:44:45.916 --> 00:44:48.958
which in turn will become anger,
which is full of truth."

00:44:50.875 --> 00:44:52.500
-It's definitely not that.
-What is it then?

00:44:52.666 --> 00:44:54.958
You dozed off without listening to your
Mom completely when you were young.

00:44:55.083 --> 00:44:56.958
Now you're not letting me sleep in peace.

00:44:57.125 --> 00:44:58.125
I can't do this anymore.

00:44:58.583 --> 00:45:01.916
Only a miracle worker can
save you from this tragedy.

00:45:12.458 --> 00:45:13.958
What's the delay, man?

00:45:14.041 --> 00:45:16.375
He said he's here, sir.
I don't know where he went.

00:45:16.708 --> 00:45:18.541
I'll go check.

00:45:18.625 --> 00:45:20.166
Sir, we'll be right back.

00:45:21.125 --> 00:45:22.333
Sir…

00:45:25.375 --> 00:45:26.250
Sir…

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.166
-Sir!
-You dare ask me!

00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:31.125
-Sir…
-What happened, sir?

00:45:35.083 --> 00:45:38.041
How dare he ask me for
directions to the toilet, Sudha?

00:45:39.166 --> 00:45:41.666
Do I look jobless enough to give
you directions to the toilet?

00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:42.875
I thought you were
a friendly police officer, sir.

00:45:42.958 --> 00:45:45.083
-Find the toilets by yourself.
-Okay, sir.

00:45:45.166 --> 00:45:48.666
Can't you do the bare minimum
to clear your bladder?

00:45:55.541 --> 00:45:58.500
-What happened, Sudha?
-Sir, he spoke to your brother.

00:45:58.750 --> 00:46:01.250
Despite telling him that you let
Govardhan go before his call came,

00:46:01.375 --> 00:46:03.500
he's creating a fuss
about the whole thing.

00:46:04.625 --> 00:46:06.166
Clients are waiting upstairs.

00:46:06.791 --> 00:46:08.291
They agreed to wait only for a month.

00:46:12.291 --> 00:46:13.458
Why is your daughter going
to Bangalore all of a sudden?

00:46:14.166 --> 00:46:16.166
Bangalore? She hasn't told me about it.

00:46:16.833 --> 00:46:17.791
You're getting a call.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:22.875
Hello, dear.

00:46:22.958 --> 00:46:25.000
Dad, I'm going to Bangalore for a meeting.

00:46:25.583 --> 00:46:27.000
That's sudden.

00:46:27.083 --> 00:46:28.958
Yeah, I know.
They informed me last minute.

00:46:29.083 --> 00:46:30.250
I have to leave early in the morning.

00:46:30.583 --> 00:46:32.708
I have a lot of packing to do. Bye, Dad.

00:46:32.875 --> 00:46:33.750
Alright.

00:46:34.125 --> 00:46:35.000
Take care.

00:46:37.541 --> 00:46:38.583
How's my network?

00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:40.375
It's like washing your face
after bawling your eyes out.

00:46:41.041 --> 00:46:44.666
Stop giving money to the peon
until she comes back at least.

00:46:45.625 --> 00:46:46.500
By the way,

00:46:47.125 --> 00:46:50.250
Mr. Chakravarthy wants you to know
that his daughter lives here.

00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:52.833
Isn't it kind of unsafe
to reveal her whereabouts?

00:46:53.250 --> 00:46:54.541
Enough of your lame jokes.

00:46:55.291 --> 00:46:56.750
What should I tell them?

00:46:57.625 --> 00:46:58.500
Hey!

00:47:02.291 --> 00:47:03.208
Is this it, Dad?

00:47:04.875 --> 00:47:06.416
Don't you think Kallu
and her husband would fight maybe?

00:47:06.708 --> 00:47:10.166
Why? Do you plan on getting her
divorced and then marrying her?

00:47:10.833 --> 00:47:12.583
Apparently, they're planning
for a second child.

00:47:13.333 --> 00:47:15.166
She doesn't even take my calls anymore.

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:17.541
-That's how busy he keeps her.
-Enough!

00:47:19.125 --> 00:47:20.250
If my aunt were alive…

00:47:21.583 --> 00:47:22.541
she wouldn't have agreed to this.

00:47:24.041 --> 00:47:25.125
If only she were alive.

00:47:27.166 --> 00:47:29.583
Don't shush me.
Your aunt helped us a great deal.

00:47:29.791 --> 00:47:31.500
We need to have some gratitude.

00:47:32.375 --> 00:47:35.166
We changed our real names
for fear of alerting your father.

00:47:35.250 --> 00:47:37.083
We dug our own graves in a way.

00:47:37.166 --> 00:47:39.375
Otherwise, you would've
been married to him by now.

00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:42.083
Hello, Subhashini alias Prabhavathi.

00:47:42.375 --> 00:47:45.208
We can show a lifetime
of gratitude for her help.

00:47:45.291 --> 00:47:49.208
But no stupid theories about
marrying Chinnu, please.

00:47:49.291 --> 00:47:52.291
You can't just assume
that he's still as aggressive.

00:47:52.833 --> 00:47:54.333
Who knows?
Maybe he's a changed man now.

00:47:54.625 --> 00:47:55.500
He'll never change.

00:47:56.125 --> 00:47:57.041
You know it.

00:48:02.958 --> 00:48:04.208
Water, please.

00:48:07.291 --> 00:48:09.500
Water, sir.

00:48:29.958 --> 00:48:31.166
-No, no.
-Have it.

00:48:46.166 --> 00:48:47.583
-Open the cell.
-Okay, sir.

00:48:50.291 --> 00:48:51.666
New joinee, sir.

00:48:53.250 --> 00:48:54.166
New joinee.

00:48:59.291 --> 00:49:00.208
Okay, sir.

00:49:11.833 --> 00:49:13.000
Charulatha.

00:49:14.166 --> 00:49:17.041
I guess you have a helping nature.

00:49:34.458 --> 00:49:36.750
I love the perfume.

00:49:38.416 --> 00:49:40.041
-Which brand is it?
-Sir?

00:49:40.625 --> 00:49:42.333
Which perfume do you use?

00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:44.958
I don't use perfume, sir.

00:49:47.625 --> 00:49:48.708
What am I smelling then?

00:49:50.166 --> 00:49:51.083
Is it body odor?

00:49:56.083 --> 00:49:57.375
-Sudha…
-Sir.

00:49:57.541 --> 00:49:58.541
Stop laughing.

00:49:59.791 --> 00:50:02.833
I just found a new perfume for our car.

00:50:04.041 --> 00:50:04.916
Talk to her.

00:50:05.625 --> 00:50:09.333
-Hey!
-Sir! Sir! No!

00:50:10.708 --> 00:50:12.125
I warned you against this.

00:50:12.708 --> 00:50:15.541
We're not allowed to offer him
anything without the CI's permission.

00:50:15.875 --> 00:50:16.750
But you didn't listen.

00:50:16.833 --> 00:50:19.375
That man reminded me of my mom, sir.

00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:24.875
My dad used to beat up
my mom daily for no reason.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:30.875
We would wait in hope every day
to get out of that hell hole.

00:50:33.166 --> 00:50:35.666
To be honest,
that's why I took up this job.

00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:40.416
In the hope of doing my best
to help other women like my mom.

00:50:42.916 --> 00:50:45.458
If so, you should help
everyone in that village.

00:50:47.125 --> 00:50:48.250
Sokulapalem.

00:51:04.291 --> 00:51:06.083
It used to be a criminal hub.

00:51:07.041 --> 00:51:10.125
It's a crime-free region now.

00:51:12.083 --> 00:51:15.375
They've swayed away
from crimes long ago.

00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:22.625
But they're still paying the cost
for their ancestors' mistakes.

00:51:23.666 --> 00:51:25.041
They can't find work anywhere.

00:51:25.458 --> 00:51:27.375
Even if they want to get
a new job somewhere else…

00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:29.625
or earn a livelihood here…

00:51:30.041 --> 00:51:31.750
they need the CI's stamp of approval.

00:51:33.583 --> 00:51:34.875
What's the problem, sir?

00:51:36.166 --> 00:51:40.208
A few years ago, our CI's land
ended up in a court litigation.

00:51:40.666 --> 00:51:42.541
Guess who filed the case.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.125
It was his elder brother, Kurmanand.

00:51:47.250 --> 00:51:48.916
Our CI was unlucky.

00:51:49.083 --> 00:51:53.875
Kurmanand became the Corporator with
the support of the people of Sokulapalem.

00:51:54.291 --> 00:51:57.416
He used that influence
to win the court case.

00:51:57.833 --> 00:51:59.791
The verdict said
that our CI couldn't access

00:51:59.875 --> 00:52:02.041
that land without his brother's signature.

00:52:06.416 --> 00:52:09.583
He didn't do any good
to the people as a Corporator.

00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:13.041
But our CI blamed the people
for putting him in this position.

00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:17.458
He developed deep anger
for the people of Sokulapalem.

00:52:17.666 --> 00:52:20.416
He couldn't get back at his brother
since he's politically powerful now.

00:52:20.541 --> 00:52:22.583
Hence, every time he's angry with him,

00:52:23.041 --> 00:52:24.458
he goes to Sokulapalem.

00:52:24.958 --> 00:52:26.666
He picks one of them.

00:52:26.791 --> 00:52:27.916
He arrests them.

00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:29.333
He files odd cases on them.

00:52:29.708 --> 00:52:30.583
He hits them.

00:52:31.125 --> 00:52:32.000
He hits them.

00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:33.958
He keeps hitting them.

00:52:34.750 --> 00:52:35.708
Hey!

00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:38.875
Has nobody ever complained against him?

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:40.916
A complaint?

00:52:41.708 --> 00:52:42.583
Against him?

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:45.375
Against our Daya?

00:52:47.583 --> 00:52:48.625
Look at that.

00:52:48.958 --> 00:52:51.125
She waits there every day.

00:52:51.541 --> 00:52:54.583
Has she stepped into the station once
and questioned him?

00:52:55.416 --> 00:52:56.375
She won't.

00:52:56.666 --> 00:52:57.583
It's fear.

00:52:58.083 --> 00:53:02.333
They just hope that he cuts back
on the beating after seeing them.

00:53:04.666 --> 00:53:07.333
That's their only battle.

00:53:14.666 --> 00:53:16.208
SOKULAPALEM

00:53:24.625 --> 00:53:26.208
Where does Raju live?

00:53:28.625 --> 00:53:29.708
Thanks.

00:53:34.625 --> 00:53:35.708
-Mom…
-Is your mom home?

00:53:36.083 --> 00:53:37.083
Mom…

00:53:40.958 --> 00:53:42.500
Raju hasn't eaten in five days.

00:53:45.666 --> 00:53:47.791
-I know, ma'am.
-Then pack lunch quickly.

00:53:47.875 --> 00:53:48.916
I have to go.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:05.916
-Namaste, ma'am.
-Namaste.

00:54:06.708 --> 00:54:08.791
-What do you do?
-I'm a carpenter, ma'am.

00:54:10.125 --> 00:54:11.166
I run that chicken shop, ma'am.

00:54:13.791 --> 00:54:15.833
Don't worry, I've got this.

00:54:15.958 --> 00:54:16.875
Bye.

00:54:17.166 --> 00:54:18.041
Bye.

00:54:19.250 --> 00:54:21.583
Should I be happy that
he got to eat today?

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.333
Or should I be sad wondering how long
this will persist? I don't know.

00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:29.791
None of us expected this hint
of positivity, right?

00:54:31.291 --> 00:54:32.791
Look at this.

00:54:33.375 --> 00:54:34.500
I hurt myself.

00:54:34.916 --> 00:54:37.666
They say this is karma
for your past mistakes.

00:54:39.041 --> 00:54:42.458
If this is the level of pain we're
subjected to for our petty mistakes…

00:54:43.583 --> 00:54:48.208
imagine the kind of hammering that monster
is going to receive for torturing us.

00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:04.750
Charu…

00:55:06.208 --> 00:55:07.375
Get in. Charu, let's go.

00:55:08.583 --> 00:55:09.958
-Did you hurt yourself at the shoot?
-Yes, sir.

00:55:11.791 --> 00:55:12.708
Sir.

00:55:14.250 --> 00:55:15.166
Here.

00:55:28.250 --> 00:55:29.208
Sorry.

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:31.791
Sorry? Don't you have common sense?

00:55:43.416 --> 00:55:45.250
-What did you say?
-I said don't you have common sense?

00:55:45.541 --> 00:55:47.708
-You're supposed to be careful.
-I apologized, right?

00:55:47.875 --> 00:55:49.416
Is an apology sufficient?

00:55:49.625 --> 00:55:50.583
What if something happened?

00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:55.625
What if something happened?

00:55:57.125 --> 00:55:58.416
-Sudha, go stand there.
-Sir.

00:55:58.708 --> 00:56:01.541
-Sir, don't. We're at a hospital.
-Stand behind the car. Go, go, go.

00:56:02.083 --> 00:56:04.125
-Charu, come.
-Sir.

00:56:04.333 --> 00:56:05.208
Stand in the center.

00:56:08.916 --> 00:56:10.000
If the car moves…

00:56:12.166 --> 00:56:13.083
I'll kill you both.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:16.375
What if something happened?

00:56:25.708 --> 00:56:26.583
Sir!

00:56:30.750 --> 00:56:33.125
There was a demon called
Narakasur in the olden days.

00:56:33.208 --> 00:56:34.250
He used to trouble people a lot.

00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:08.416
Sir, stop!

00:57:28.625 --> 00:57:29.541
Who the hell are you?

00:57:31.416 --> 00:57:32.375
An explosion waiting to happen.

00:57:33.875 --> 00:57:35.958
Your car, sir. Petrol is leaking.

00:57:37.708 --> 00:57:39.083
What if it catches fire
from all the thudding?

00:57:40.416 --> 00:57:41.333
You'll be dead.

00:57:42.125 --> 00:57:43.291
Dead beyond recognition.

00:57:48.416 --> 00:57:49.333
-Check it.
-Sir.

00:57:53.583 --> 00:57:55.750
Yes, sir. There's a leak.

00:58:00.125 --> 00:58:01.125
Aunty…

00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:03.500
I do have common sense.

00:58:46.291 --> 00:58:47.166
Hi.

00:58:50.583 --> 00:58:51.500
Your bottle cap.

00:58:52.083 --> 00:58:53.000
It's not mine.

00:58:53.875 --> 00:58:54.750
I saw what you did.

00:58:54.833 --> 00:58:56.458
Thanks for saving that lady.

00:58:58.750 --> 00:58:59.666
I'm Charulatha.

00:59:01.916 --> 00:59:02.875
Surya.

00:59:05.208 --> 00:59:06.083
Hello, ma'am?

00:59:12.041 --> 00:59:13.083
I see that your bike ran out of fuel.

00:59:14.791 --> 00:59:16.166
Come, I'll take you to the petrol pump.

00:59:16.458 --> 00:59:17.458
Oh, no. It's okay.

00:59:18.583 --> 00:59:20.041
I know it's okay.
That's why I offered to help.

00:59:26.625 --> 00:59:28.333
Do you have a bottle to carry the petrol?

00:59:29.583 --> 00:59:30.458
No.

00:59:35.625 --> 00:59:36.500
Let's go.

00:59:44.708 --> 00:59:45.625
What's wrong?

00:59:46.208 --> 00:59:47.291
I guess my bike ran out of fuel now.

01:00:36.458 --> 01:00:38.125
-I do have common sense.
-Sir!

01:00:42.041 --> 01:00:43.166
Aunty…

01:01:05.166 --> 01:01:06.958
-Dad!
-What is it now?

01:01:07.041 --> 01:01:08.500
The "true anger" dream?

01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:10.791
I watched a white guy's sermon just now.

01:01:10.875 --> 01:01:12.708
I'll explain everything after this show.

01:01:12.791 --> 01:01:14.291
No, wait. Let me watch.

01:01:14.458 --> 01:01:15.583
-It's not that, Dad.
-Damn.

01:01:18.208 --> 01:01:19.875
-Two things happened today.
-What are those?

01:01:19.958 --> 01:01:21.375
-I got angry at a guy.
-It's common.

01:01:21.458 --> 01:01:22.583
And I met a girl.

01:01:23.291 --> 01:01:24.375
I met her and came back home.

01:01:24.875 --> 01:01:27.208
I sat down to write his name
but I can't stop thinking about her.

01:01:27.708 --> 01:01:28.625
I'm not able to pen down the name.

01:01:30.750 --> 01:01:32.000
I can't seem to understand why.

01:01:32.291 --> 01:01:33.375
Who's this girl?

01:01:34.625 --> 01:01:35.750
Her name is Charulatha.

01:01:36.125 --> 01:01:37.375
Charu…

01:01:38.458 --> 01:01:39.958
Her name starts with "Cha"
just like Mom's.

01:01:41.208 --> 01:01:42.375
Chayadevi. Charulatha.

01:01:43.208 --> 01:01:44.250
Do you think that's the connection?

01:01:44.708 --> 01:01:47.291
We have a neighbor
called Chamundeshwari.

01:01:47.958 --> 01:01:50.666
Did you ever look at her
and feel this way?

01:01:52.458 --> 01:01:53.958
See? It's not in the name.

01:01:54.750 --> 01:01:55.750
Listen to me.

01:01:56.333 --> 01:01:59.166
If there's an emotion beyond your anger…

01:01:59.833 --> 01:02:01.000
what could it be?

01:02:02.666 --> 01:02:03.625
What could it be?

01:02:17.833 --> 01:02:20.750
What's happening to me?

01:02:21.291 --> 01:02:24.041
These are joys I'm not used to

01:02:24.125 --> 01:02:30.750
Something has nestled in my heart

01:02:31.583 --> 01:02:34.666
My emotions change

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.750
My anger is calmed when I'm with you

01:02:37.833 --> 01:02:44.125
Your intoxication lightens my heart

01:02:44.666 --> 01:02:50.958
The heart is unlike yesterday

01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:58.208
It doesn't respond to me when I ask why

01:02:58.458 --> 01:03:01.541
A bubbling heart

01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:05.250
And excitement in my breath

01:03:05.375 --> 01:03:08.458
I'm drenched in
Showers of your thoughts

01:03:08.541 --> 01:03:12.000
This connection is destined to be

01:03:12.083 --> 01:03:15.333
Whispers of silence

01:03:15.458 --> 01:03:18.833
Words slip away from the lips

01:03:18.916 --> 01:03:22.208
Our imagination touches the skies

01:03:22.291 --> 01:03:25.833
Where are we headed?

01:03:26.458 --> 01:03:29.333
What's happening to me?

01:03:29.833 --> 01:03:31.083
These are joys I'm not used to

01:03:31.166 --> 01:03:32.750
He has the same name as your nephew.

01:03:33.083 --> 01:03:36.833
But he's nothing like your Chinnu.

01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:41.958
Every time I look at Charu,

01:03:42.708 --> 01:03:44.125
she reminds me so much of Kallu.

01:03:44.625 --> 01:03:46.833
Her smile, the way she talks, all of it.

01:03:47.250 --> 01:03:50.458
I didn't have this feeling
when I met the real Kallu, Dad.

01:03:50.708 --> 01:03:52.000
Simple.

01:03:52.375 --> 01:03:55.250
We tend to see our loved ones
in the people we love.

01:03:55.375 --> 01:03:56.500
Kallu is married now.

01:03:56.583 --> 01:03:59.083
So, you're thinking of the young Kallu
every time you see Charu.

01:04:05.125 --> 01:04:07.583
-Do you think he found the real Kallu?
-I don't think so.

01:04:07.666 --> 01:04:14.333
It feels like I'm cloaked by your thoughts

01:04:14.458 --> 01:04:19.666
When you smile with all your heart

01:04:20.208 --> 01:04:23.041
New light enters my eyes

01:04:23.125 --> 01:04:25.750
Sokulapalem is a thieves' den, right?

01:04:27.208 --> 01:04:29.708
I don't have any proof to prove otherwise.

01:04:30.250 --> 01:04:32.291
But they really need this insurance.

01:04:32.625 --> 01:04:34.291
Please do it for me, Surya.

01:04:34.375 --> 01:04:40.458
The threads of our hands are intertwined
Strengthened by fate

01:04:40.541 --> 01:04:44.541
We will not be separated

01:04:44.625 --> 01:04:48.416
But will move forward as a pair

01:04:49.791 --> 01:04:53.083
A bubbling heart

01:04:53.250 --> 01:04:56.583
And excitement in my breath

01:04:56.666 --> 01:04:59.958
I'm drenched in
Showers of your thoughts

01:05:00.041 --> 01:05:02.500
This connection is destined to be

01:05:29.583 --> 01:05:30.458
Girlfriend?

01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:34.833
I liked my aunt's daughter
when I was young.

01:05:35.250 --> 01:05:36.500
-But she's married now.
-Oh.

01:05:40.791 --> 01:05:41.666
What about you?

01:05:43.833 --> 01:05:47.250
The guy I'm going to marry shouldn't
even know the spelling of violence.

01:05:47.666 --> 01:05:48.791
Where can I find one these days?

01:05:57.083 --> 01:05:58.000
Oh, this is where you live.

01:06:01.125 --> 01:06:03.333
Please don't mind me not inviting you in.

01:06:03.458 --> 01:06:04.833
Mom might have a problem.

01:06:05.791 --> 01:06:07.291
Hey, it's totally alright.

01:06:08.208 --> 01:06:09.875
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, it's okay.

01:06:10.333 --> 01:06:11.583
-Bye.
-Bye.

01:06:11.916 --> 01:06:12.791
Charu…

01:06:14.625 --> 01:06:18.208
So, does the alphabet "S"
appear once or twice in the word violence?

01:06:18.333 --> 01:06:20.208
Lense… There must be an S.

01:06:21.666 --> 01:06:23.291
-Bye.
-No, I really don't know.

01:06:23.375 --> 01:06:24.375
Is it a single S or double S?

01:06:28.416 --> 01:06:31.791
Hey, she's growing fond of you
because of those six days.

01:06:32.375 --> 01:06:34.750
God forbid she finds out
about your seventh day.

01:06:34.833 --> 01:06:36.541
How will she find out?

01:06:37.666 --> 01:06:38.541
How will she find out?

01:06:40.958 --> 01:06:41.958
I got discharged yesterday, man.

01:06:44.666 --> 01:06:46.000
Sorry, ma'am.

01:06:48.875 --> 01:06:50.375
Forgive us for our mistake, ma'am.

01:06:53.583 --> 01:06:54.666
Hello.

01:07:11.708 --> 01:07:12.625
Look at this.

01:07:13.291 --> 01:07:15.500
Swamy, the bakery guy, and my SI.

01:07:15.666 --> 01:07:17.125
He hit all of them on a Saturday.

01:07:17.250 --> 01:07:19.458
Which means,
he hits people only on Saturdays.

01:07:19.875 --> 01:07:21.666
You're acting like Prakash Raj
from the film Tagore.

01:07:22.250 --> 01:07:24.250
You solved 90 percent of the case.

01:07:24.333 --> 01:07:25.208
Is that a joke?

01:07:26.291 --> 01:07:27.791
You don't get it.

01:07:28.541 --> 01:07:30.666
He's observing me closely.

01:07:31.458 --> 01:07:33.958
I'm worried about what
he might do in the future.

01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:36.833
Do you think that's him?

01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:39.708
-Who?
-The Saturday guy.

01:07:40.541 --> 01:07:42.666
You're overthinking this.
He's not so cool.

01:07:42.750 --> 01:07:44.125
Forget about him.

01:07:44.458 --> 01:07:45.708
How can I just let it go?

01:07:47.916 --> 01:07:49.541
How do I explain it to you?

01:07:50.041 --> 01:07:51.166
Okay.

01:07:52.041 --> 01:07:53.708
Take the movie Eega for example.

01:07:54.041 --> 01:07:55.708
Nani loves Samantha.

01:07:55.916 --> 01:07:57.416
Samantha loves Nani as well.

01:07:58.250 --> 01:07:59.750
But before she can express her love…

01:08:00.166 --> 01:08:01.875
Kiccha Sudeep kills Nani.

01:08:02.291 --> 01:08:04.958
Nani was reborn as a fly
because it's a movie.

01:08:05.291 --> 01:08:07.166
-But what do we do in real life?
-Yeah, not possible.

01:08:08.166 --> 01:08:12.166
I have a feeling that this guy
is like Kiccha Sudeep.

01:08:13.125 --> 01:08:14.208
You get it?

01:08:20.958 --> 01:08:22.916
Are you saying the
Saturday guy is Kiccha Sudeep?

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.083
Yeah.

01:08:26.125 --> 01:08:27.583
-Samantha?
-That's me.

01:08:30.458 --> 01:08:31.333
Who's Nani?

01:08:33.166 --> 01:08:34.916
Are you crazy? You are Nani.

01:08:35.291 --> 01:08:38.583
-Me?
-A bubbling heart

01:08:38.708 --> 01:08:42.125
And excitement in my breath

01:08:42.208 --> 01:08:45.375
I'm drenched in
Showers of your thoughts

01:08:45.458 --> 01:08:49.000
This connection is destined to be

01:08:49.083 --> 01:08:52.208
Whispers of silence

01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:55.833
Words slip away from the lips

01:08:55.916 --> 01:08:58.625
Our imagination touches the skies

01:08:58.708 --> 01:09:00.875
Dad, she's calling.
I'll be talking to her.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.625
You keep saying, "Nani, come here.
Nani, do this, etc."

01:09:02.708 --> 01:09:04.958
-Nani? Who's that?
-It's me!

01:09:07.541 --> 01:09:09.125
Hello, I'm just at home.

01:09:09.416 --> 01:09:11.041
-Nani!
-Yes, Dad?

01:09:11.208 --> 01:09:12.250
Come and do the dishes.

01:09:14.833 --> 01:09:16.625
-The food is delicious?
-No, come do the dishes.

01:09:17.416 --> 01:09:18.750
Yeah, coming.

01:09:26.875 --> 01:09:29.000
THE KNOT

01:09:29.166 --> 01:09:30.500
-Don't turn right. Turn left.
-That road is bad.

01:09:30.583 --> 01:09:32.041
-I said turn left.
-Got it, brother.

01:09:34.208 --> 01:09:35.708
I agree what Daya did in my case is wrong.

01:09:36.833 --> 01:09:39.166
But he let me go before
your call came that day.

01:09:39.416 --> 01:09:40.791
Trust me on this once.

01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:43.416
Do we need this drama hanging over us?

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.583
Sir, he's your little brother after all.

01:09:46.666 --> 01:09:48.000
He's been asking you for a long time now.

01:09:48.166 --> 01:09:50.708
Why don't you meet him
and sign the papers?

01:09:51.208 --> 01:09:53.500
-What's wrong?
-The road is blocked.

01:09:55.416 --> 01:09:57.958
Why is my judgment so off every time?

01:09:59.250 --> 01:10:00.625
Always the wrong judgment!

01:10:02.375 --> 01:10:03.250
But first, sir…

01:10:04.166 --> 01:10:05.041
What do we do now?

01:10:05.291 --> 01:10:06.875
-What?
-What do we do now?

01:10:16.166 --> 01:10:17.916
-Open the cell.
-Yes, sir.

01:10:23.583 --> 01:10:26.000
-Sir, sir…
-Hey! It's sharp. Get back.

01:10:26.250 --> 01:10:28.583
-Be careful, man. Don't be scared.
-Sir.

01:10:31.958 --> 01:10:32.833
Raju…

01:10:33.708 --> 01:10:34.708
Do you want to go home?

01:10:35.958 --> 01:10:36.875
Go.

01:10:37.416 --> 01:10:39.125
-Sudha, release him.
-Sir.

01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:40.625
How come, sir?

01:10:40.791 --> 01:10:43.833
My brother is giving me my land back.

01:10:44.583 --> 01:10:46.916
He's going to sign the agreement
once he's back in the city.

01:10:47.250 --> 01:10:48.750
I don't need this guy anymore.

01:10:49.916 --> 01:10:50.833
Dude, go.

01:10:53.291 --> 01:10:54.166
Be happy.

01:10:55.333 --> 01:10:56.541
Go, go, go.

01:10:58.708 --> 01:11:00.916
Go tell everyone to be happy.

01:11:04.208 --> 01:11:06.000
The agreement will be signed
on the coming Saturday.

01:11:06.583 --> 01:11:08.125
I'll get my land back.

01:11:13.125 --> 01:11:14.875
Take it off!

01:11:15.083 --> 01:11:16.541
Bro, he has a girlfriend.

01:11:18.166 --> 01:11:19.250
I'm glad.

01:11:19.625 --> 01:11:21.750
Should we get them both married?

01:11:21.875 --> 01:11:24.291
Brother, she doesn't know
about his Saturday concept.

01:11:31.541 --> 01:11:32.625
That means…

01:11:33.333 --> 01:11:36.708
he won't lift a finger in her
presence even on a Saturday.

01:11:37.625 --> 01:11:40.000
If he does, he'll get
into trouble with her.

01:11:40.625 --> 01:11:43.458
If he doesn't,
he'll get into trouble with us.

01:11:46.541 --> 01:11:47.916
Fantastic!

01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:52.041
The time has come to hit
him on a Saturday, Martin!

01:11:52.541 --> 01:11:53.541
Go!

01:11:53.958 --> 01:11:55.583
Take our whole gang.

01:11:56.166 --> 01:11:59.416
Let's check out his eternal love story.

01:12:00.583 --> 01:12:01.750
-Hey!
-Brother…

01:12:04.541 --> 01:12:07.291
I'm getting some surgery done tomorrow.

01:12:08.041 --> 01:12:10.500
I want to hear good news before that.

01:12:11.208 --> 01:12:12.166
Go, go.

01:12:13.958 --> 01:12:15.208
Mom, I'm off to work.

01:12:17.291 --> 01:12:18.708
What does he like to eat?

01:12:27.041 --> 01:12:28.041
Shall I invite him over?

01:12:32.958 --> 01:12:36.125
Now that she's told her mom about you,

01:12:36.208 --> 01:12:39.166
I think it's unfair to
hide the truth from her.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.500
True. Let's say before you confess,

01:12:42.916 --> 01:12:45.750
she finds out that you're
both Nani and Kiccha Sudeep,

01:12:45.833 --> 01:12:46.958
the movie won't be called
Eega anymore.

01:12:47.458 --> 01:12:48.458
It'd be called Gabbilam.

01:12:51.083 --> 01:12:53.000
I'm afraid about how she'll react, Dad.

01:12:53.375 --> 01:12:54.250
Hey…

01:12:54.750 --> 01:12:57.666
If you confess,
you'll be telling the truth.

01:12:58.458 --> 01:13:00.333
But if she finds out…

01:13:00.666 --> 01:13:02.250
you'll be cheating her.

01:13:02.958 --> 01:13:04.000
Think about it.

01:13:11.916 --> 01:13:13.583
-All hail…
-Mr. Kurmanand!

01:13:13.666 --> 01:13:15.375
-All hail…
-Mr. Kurmanand!

01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:16.875
-All hail…
-Mr. Kurmanand!

01:13:16.958 --> 01:13:20.000
-All hail…
-Mr. Kurmanand!

01:13:20.083 --> 01:13:23.333
-All hail…
-Mr. Kurmanand!

01:13:23.416 --> 01:13:24.833
Sir, Mr. Daya is here.

01:13:32.041 --> 01:13:33.916
What did he call you? Tissue paper?

01:13:34.791 --> 01:13:35.916
Let that go, brother.

01:13:36.250 --> 01:13:38.291
Just sign the land papers
and be done with it.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:45.875
That… I…

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:52.875
Sir.

01:13:52.958 --> 01:13:55.708
Go and ask if he would
like to have coffee or tea.

01:13:56.083 --> 01:13:57.083
Okay, sir.

01:13:57.541 --> 01:13:58.791
-Did you get it?
-Sir?

01:13:59.416 --> 01:14:00.416
Ask him.

01:14:01.666 --> 01:14:03.458
-Don't serve anything. Go.
-Okay, sir.

01:14:05.458 --> 01:14:07.083
Sir, would you like to have coffee or tea?

01:14:07.583 --> 01:14:09.083
Sir, shall I order coffee?

01:14:11.250 --> 01:14:12.958
-One coffee and one tea.
-Okay, sir.

01:14:13.041 --> 01:14:15.291
-And one water bottle.
-Okay, sir.

01:14:18.541 --> 01:14:21.791
Why do you sound so serious and formal?

01:14:22.125 --> 01:14:24.041
-What is this about?
-I'll tell you when we meet.

01:14:24.375 --> 01:14:26.333
You're going to meet Mom
and me in the evening anyway.

01:14:26.625 --> 01:14:29.500
Yeah, I want to meet you once before that.

01:14:30.791 --> 01:14:31.916
Okay.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.291
Sir, coffee or tea?

01:14:49.250 --> 01:14:51.875
Hey, we ordered half an hour ago.

01:14:52.208 --> 01:14:53.791
-Sorry, sir. I totally forgot.
-What?

01:14:54.375 --> 01:14:57.125
-One coffee, one tea, and a water bottle.
-Okay, sir.

01:14:57.208 --> 01:14:59.541
Also, tell him that Daya sir is waiting.

01:14:59.625 --> 01:15:00.583
-Okay, sir.
-Yes.

01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:22.208
Sir, would you like to have coffee or tea?

01:15:22.666 --> 01:15:25.000
Are you guys kidding me?
How many times do we…

01:15:29.625 --> 01:15:30.541
One coffee.

01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:32.375
One tea.

01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:35.291
And a water bottle if you may.

01:15:38.416 --> 01:15:39.625
-Hello.
-Who's next?

01:15:39.958 --> 01:15:43.833
-Bro, I'm sending Kumar in.
-Go ahead.

01:15:46.541 --> 01:15:48.375
Sir, would you like to have coffee or tea?

01:16:50.458 --> 01:16:51.416
Choose your words wisely.

01:16:57.125 --> 01:16:58.625
-Is that him? Let's go!
-Hurry up! Go, go, go!

01:16:59.583 --> 01:17:01.083
I'm sure it was deliberate.

01:17:01.541 --> 01:17:04.333
We made a huge mistake
by letting Govardhan go that day.

01:17:04.666 --> 01:17:05.708
Otherwise…

01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:07.375
Let's go.

01:17:15.416 --> 01:17:17.208
Get inside! Go! Go!

01:17:22.583 --> 01:17:24.333
Please don't hit me, sir.

01:17:30.291 --> 01:17:31.166
Please, don't hit me.

01:17:45.583 --> 01:17:47.625
-What's the update?
-She's not here yet.

01:17:48.083 --> 01:17:50.541
You should attack him
only in her presence.

01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:53.125
Otherwise, he'll wreak havoc on you guys.

01:17:53.250 --> 01:17:54.125
Alright.

01:17:58.333 --> 01:18:00.333
You dare to have his picture?

01:18:00.708 --> 01:18:04.000
-Do you think so highly of him?
-Sir, no!

01:18:05.708 --> 01:18:09.625
Sir, please don't hit him. He'll die!
Sir, please stop! Sir!

01:18:09.708 --> 01:18:11.375
-Sir, please stop!
-Mom!

01:18:12.083 --> 01:18:15.875
-Sir, let me go.
-Sir, please let go of my dad.

01:18:15.958 --> 01:18:17.625
Sir, let her go!

01:18:23.208 --> 01:18:24.333
Lalli!

01:18:25.958 --> 01:18:26.833
Lalli!

01:18:28.458 --> 01:18:29.333
Lalli!

01:18:29.708 --> 01:18:31.208
I think the little girl is hurt.

01:18:31.583 --> 01:18:32.583
Hey!

01:18:33.583 --> 01:18:35.291
I'll kill you if you move forward.

01:18:41.041 --> 01:18:42.625
He invited me home on the premise
of giving my land back…

01:18:43.208 --> 01:18:44.166
Lalli!

01:18:44.416 --> 01:18:47.041
and went on to humiliate me further.

01:18:47.125 --> 01:18:49.875
How could you paint such a man's picture?

01:18:55.416 --> 01:18:56.666
Hello, where are you? It's been a while.

01:18:56.750 --> 01:18:59.666
-Why did you paint his picture?
-Lalitha…

01:18:59.750 --> 01:19:01.291
If I hear his name again,

01:19:01.708 --> 01:19:04.833
-I'll turn Sokulapalem into a graveyard.
-Lalitha.

01:19:05.208 --> 01:19:07.083
Trust me!

01:19:24.875 --> 01:19:25.750
Oh, dear!

01:19:25.875 --> 01:19:27.500
Dear!

01:19:28.083 --> 01:19:29.291
Brother, somebody, help!

01:19:29.416 --> 01:19:31.125
He left.

01:19:31.375 --> 01:19:33.583
Somebody, help!

01:19:34.208 --> 01:19:36.208
Somebody, please come forward.

01:19:36.541 --> 01:19:38.375
My girl is going to die.

01:19:43.375 --> 01:19:44.333
Lalli…

01:19:44.625 --> 01:19:45.625
Lalli…

01:19:47.791 --> 01:19:48.666
Lalli!

01:20:31.333 --> 01:20:32.250
How is she doing?

01:20:33.833 --> 01:20:34.708
They're checking.

01:20:47.541 --> 01:20:49.166
It's high time that you file a complaint.

01:20:51.041 --> 01:20:52.000
I'm talking to you.

01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:57.833
File a complaint and kill her
chances of survival completely?

01:20:58.666 --> 01:20:59.625
I don't want that.

01:21:00.250 --> 01:21:01.625
We're used to this misery.

01:21:02.041 --> 01:21:03.166
How can you say that?

01:21:03.833 --> 01:21:06.875
If you file a complaint, this
won't happen to someone else.

01:21:08.750 --> 01:21:11.375
If only the people before
us took some action,

01:21:11.666 --> 01:21:13.166
we wouldn't be subjected
to this suffering now.

01:21:13.833 --> 01:21:16.083
Why should we worry about someone else?

01:21:17.375 --> 01:21:19.666
We're all united in fear.

01:21:20.375 --> 01:21:22.000
Not in fighting that demon.

01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:39.791
Where is your CI right now?

01:21:40.833 --> 01:21:42.500
What will you do about it, Surya?

01:21:44.333 --> 01:21:47.583
This isn't as easy as saving
that woman by spilling petrol.

01:21:51.833 --> 01:21:55.958
All we can do is listen,
watch, and sit in agony.

01:21:58.500 --> 01:21:59.625
We're hopeless.

01:22:01.666 --> 01:22:02.958
Today is a Saturday.

01:22:05.125 --> 01:22:06.458
You know what I feel right now?

01:22:08.541 --> 01:22:10.000
If that Saturday guy were here…

01:22:10.916 --> 01:22:14.625
right now, standing in front of me…

01:22:16.958 --> 01:22:18.958
I would want to ask him for a favor.

01:22:24.833 --> 01:22:25.750
Ask.

01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:54.041
I told you he won't lift a finger
in her presence even on a Saturday.

01:23:49.625 --> 01:23:53.125
He, the one who breaks
The shackles of doubt

01:23:53.208 --> 01:23:56.041
With a fierce and intense gaze

01:23:56.125 --> 01:23:58.916
His nails are like blazing
Flames on a mountain

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.791
He is the constant force
Of balance on a Saturday

01:24:01.875 --> 01:24:02.875
Ask.

01:24:25.041 --> 01:24:29.000
This is a fight between you and me.
Why did you guys touch her?

01:25:11.291 --> 01:25:13.041
I can express anger only one day a week.

01:25:16.958 --> 01:25:18.333
My mom took this promise from me.

01:25:20.041 --> 01:25:21.125
That's the deal with Saturday.

01:25:22.875 --> 01:25:24.000
Only on a Saturday.

01:26:21.333 --> 01:26:22.916
I don't know what favor you wanted to ask.

01:26:28.666 --> 01:26:29.958
But I got angry.

01:26:30.583 --> 01:26:31.833
And because I'm angry,

01:26:33.125 --> 01:26:34.916
this problem just became my problem.

01:26:36.458 --> 01:26:37.958
Sokulapalem is my family now.

01:27:16.833 --> 01:27:18.041
I have to go to work in the morning.

01:27:18.875 --> 01:27:19.833
We don't have an off day.

01:27:20.916 --> 01:27:21.791
You don't work on Sundays, right?

01:27:22.458 --> 01:27:23.500
I guess so.

01:27:28.708 --> 01:27:29.708
I hope the girl will be fine.

01:27:36.750 --> 01:27:37.625
What did you say his name was?

01:27:39.458 --> 01:27:40.333
Oh.

01:27:41.708 --> 01:27:42.583
Daya.

01:27:43.833 --> 01:27:44.791
Daya.

01:27:50.375 --> 01:27:52.666
SOKULAPALEM

01:27:54.166 --> 01:27:56.625
There lived a demon called
Narakasur in the olden days.

01:27:56.708 --> 01:27:57.833
Come, come!

01:28:02.375 --> 01:28:03.958
He used to trouble people a lot.

01:28:08.791 --> 01:28:11.375
So Sri Krishna and
Satyabhama teamed up and…

01:28:14.333 --> 01:28:15.416
killed him!

01:28:21.583 --> 01:28:24.000
The sound of crackling
It's like the roaring of the sky

01:28:24.083 --> 01:28:26.458
Here's to the fall of the mighty ones
The blazing ground is scorched

01:28:26.541 --> 01:28:28.958
The battle that cannot be unseen
Blood has already begun to boil

01:28:29.041 --> 01:28:31.625
The war has tipped the balance
Destruction is inevitable

01:28:31.708 --> 01:28:34.000
You've played a big game.

01:28:40.125 --> 01:28:42.875
The war has tipped the balance
Destruction is inevitable

01:28:44.708 --> 01:28:46.833
You've played a big game.

01:28:49.750 --> 01:28:52.208
CROSSROADS

01:28:52.291 --> 01:28:54.708
Bhadru, how are your sugar levels?

01:28:57.708 --> 01:28:58.916
You're in your ninth month.

01:28:59.083 --> 01:29:01.125
Tell your family at least now.

01:29:02.125 --> 01:29:03.000
Did you eat?

01:29:03.250 --> 01:29:04.625
How long will you keep avoiding this?

01:29:05.125 --> 01:29:06.666
Don't act so stubborn.

01:29:07.708 --> 01:29:10.041
You lied about going to Bangalore
and stayed back in the same city.

01:29:10.416 --> 01:29:12.875
What's the need to live at
your friend's place like this?

01:29:13.375 --> 01:29:14.625
I'm not with you during a time like this.

01:29:14.958 --> 01:29:17.583
I feel guilty
to leave you all by yourself.

01:29:18.166 --> 01:29:19.208
Think about it.

01:29:24.666 --> 01:29:25.541
Hey…

01:29:26.458 --> 01:29:27.750
Did you tell her?

01:29:28.708 --> 01:29:29.791
Yeah.

01:29:30.041 --> 01:29:30.958
What did she say?

01:29:32.958 --> 01:29:34.083
She left without saying a word.

01:29:34.333 --> 01:29:35.250
She left?

01:29:36.166 --> 01:29:37.875
Did you tell her properly or not?

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:38.875
I didn't just tell her.

01:29:40.291 --> 01:29:41.333
I showed her.

01:29:41.625 --> 01:29:42.708
What do you mean?

01:29:45.083 --> 01:29:46.583
I don't know what to do, Mom.

01:29:48.041 --> 01:29:50.666
He's the kind of guy
I didn't want in my life.

01:29:51.708 --> 01:29:53.708
But I fell in love with the same guy.

01:29:55.583 --> 01:29:57.291
Even though I know the truth,

01:29:58.125 --> 01:29:59.750
I don't feel like losing him.

01:30:02.375 --> 01:30:04.125
Is it the situation…

01:30:05.708 --> 01:30:07.291
or is it my love for him?

01:30:10.791 --> 01:30:12.000
I just don't understand.

01:30:12.541 --> 01:30:14.041
SUNDAY

01:30:14.666 --> 01:30:15.875
Thanks for understanding.

01:30:19.166 --> 01:30:21.583
What do you plan on doing this Saturday?

01:30:24.958 --> 01:30:26.416
So you're going to hit the CI, right?

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:33.041
You said the people of Sokulapalem
are family, and this is your problem now.

01:30:34.625 --> 01:30:36.791
Hitting him may calm your anger.

01:30:37.250 --> 01:30:40.541
But that doesn't mean
their problem will be solved.

01:30:45.250 --> 01:30:48.041
I don't know if I can say this
to someone who helped us.

01:30:49.458 --> 01:30:51.125
Never help us again.

01:30:52.208 --> 01:30:53.750
If something happens to you going forward,

01:30:54.375 --> 01:30:55.750
that will affect us only.

01:30:56.458 --> 01:30:59.083
Look what happened to that girl.

01:31:00.250 --> 01:31:01.166
Did anyone come forward to help?

01:31:02.291 --> 01:31:05.333
I'm one to speak.
Did I come forward to help?

01:31:08.750 --> 01:31:11.541
We've gotten used to the fear.

01:31:14.041 --> 01:31:14.958
We'll never change.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.000
This is it.

01:31:19.333 --> 01:31:20.208
We'll never change.

01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:21.416
Our lives are doomed.

01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:28.375
MONDAY

01:31:28.458 --> 01:31:29.500
I don't know what happened there.

01:31:29.708 --> 01:31:32.541
But it's highly impossible to go
ahead without your brother's signature.

01:31:32.666 --> 01:31:33.750
The clients are adamant.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:37.375
They want to buy the land before
Sunday or move on to another seller.

01:31:37.458 --> 01:31:38.875
It's not going to work
out with Kurmanand, sir.

01:31:39.291 --> 01:31:41.791
If you were there, you'd never
have coffee or tea again in your life.

01:31:41.875 --> 01:31:42.958
What do we do then?

01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:47.375
Sir, as long as your brother's here,
we need his signature.

01:31:48.791 --> 01:31:49.666
What if he isn't?

01:31:54.750 --> 01:31:56.000
What if my brother is no more?

01:31:58.583 --> 01:32:00.875
What are you talking about, sir?

01:32:01.333 --> 01:32:03.000
-It's Kurmanand, sir.
-To hell with him!

01:32:08.791 --> 01:32:11.500
You'll get the news
before the coming Sunday.

01:32:13.041 --> 01:32:14.583
Before the coming Sunday.

01:32:19.833 --> 01:32:22.166
Daya is planning to kill his brother.

01:32:22.625 --> 01:32:24.958
We just have to make sure
Kurmanand finds out about this.

01:32:29.041 --> 01:32:30.791
Then Kurmanand will deal with Daya.

01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:34.208
Do you think that's going to solve
Sokulapalem's problem?

01:32:35.291 --> 01:32:37.208
Dayanand is their only problem.

01:32:38.791 --> 01:32:39.958
Daya isn't the only problem.

01:32:41.750 --> 01:32:43.916
It's the fear that's rooted in them.

01:32:46.083 --> 01:32:47.041
Let's say Daya is gone.

01:32:48.333 --> 01:32:49.666
Tomorrow, some other
evil guy will take over.

01:32:50.750 --> 01:32:51.625
The fear will come back.

01:32:53.125 --> 01:32:54.125
That fear should disappear.

01:32:55.541 --> 01:32:59.166
And for that to happen,
they need a ray of hope in their lives.

01:32:59.750 --> 01:33:00.625
But how?

01:33:02.208 --> 01:33:05.375
Even if one guy from Sokulapalem
steps forward with courage…

01:33:06.458 --> 01:33:07.791
all their lives will change.

01:33:08.250 --> 01:33:10.375
Courage from the people of Sokulapalem?

01:33:10.750 --> 01:33:11.625
It doesn't have to be one of them.

01:33:14.041 --> 01:33:17.958
They just need to believe
that one of them already did.

01:33:20.208 --> 01:33:21.166
Isn't that enough?

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:42.708
TUESDAY

01:33:52.416 --> 01:33:53.291
Who is this guy?

01:33:54.833 --> 01:33:58.625
"My patience has worn out.
My tears have dried out.

01:33:59.291 --> 01:34:01.041
On behalf of all of us,

01:34:01.125 --> 01:34:04.708
I want to overcome the fear
and take a step forward.

01:34:04.791 --> 01:34:07.000
I'll take the first step this Saturday.

01:34:08.083 --> 01:34:09.250
One of us."

01:34:09.333 --> 01:34:10.250
Who is this guy?

01:34:11.541 --> 01:34:12.791
Who could it be?

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:14.125
One of us?

01:34:16.500 --> 01:34:17.458
It's not me, bro.

01:34:17.625 --> 01:34:19.750
What could the first step be?

01:34:23.041 --> 01:34:24.541
And why Saturday?

01:34:25.375 --> 01:34:26.625
Who could it be?

01:34:27.333 --> 01:34:28.541
He said he'll take the first step.

01:34:28.958 --> 01:34:31.375
Maybe he'll massage his feet
for these four days.

01:34:32.208 --> 01:34:34.583
Am I right, sir?
Am I right, ma'am?

01:34:34.666 --> 01:34:35.666
Have some shame!

01:34:37.083 --> 01:34:39.291
Don't you see our pain in those words?

01:34:40.791 --> 01:34:41.666
Keep watching.

01:34:42.333 --> 01:34:43.291
This Saturday…

01:34:44.083 --> 01:34:46.166
our lives are going to change.

01:34:46.583 --> 01:34:47.750
Because of one of us.

01:34:52.041 --> 01:34:54.833
There are only two common spots
in Kurmanand's routine, sir.

01:34:55.166 --> 01:34:56.583
He goes to the temple at 10:00 a.m.

01:34:59.166 --> 01:35:01.166
He goes to the pub at 11:00 p.m.

01:35:07.541 --> 01:35:10.000
But more people escort him
to the pub than the temple.

01:35:10.458 --> 01:35:12.708
So security-wise,
the temple is a better spot.

01:35:13.708 --> 01:35:14.625
Which temple does he go to?

01:35:14.750 --> 01:35:16.416
A different temple every day,
depending on which day it is.

01:35:16.583 --> 01:35:18.458
Shivalayam on Mondays,
Hanuman temple on Tuesdays,

01:35:18.625 --> 01:35:19.708
Ayyappa temple on Wednesdays.

01:35:20.041 --> 01:35:22.250
Sai Baba temple on Thursdays,
Gayatri temple on Fridays,

01:35:22.333 --> 01:35:23.333
and on Saturdays…

01:35:23.916 --> 01:35:24.916
Balaji temple.

01:35:27.583 --> 01:35:28.458
Balaji temple.

01:35:28.541 --> 01:35:29.416
WEDNESDAY

01:35:29.500 --> 01:35:31.541
But the catch is he's flying
to Delhi Thursday night.

01:35:31.666 --> 01:35:33.375
He won't be back until next Wednesday.

01:35:33.500 --> 01:35:37.125
Sir, we told the clients that the
agreement will be done by Sunday.

01:35:37.416 --> 01:35:39.916
If we postpone it, they'll
cancel the deal altogether.

01:35:40.875 --> 01:35:41.875
What do we do, sir?

01:35:42.875 --> 01:35:45.166
They're planning something at
the Sai Baba temple tomorrow.

01:35:45.750 --> 01:35:47.791
We'll move the plan to Saturday.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.000
But how?

01:35:53.291 --> 01:35:54.625
Surya, my boy!

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.333
Sir, I found the Chief Guest
for our 25th anniversary.

01:35:57.500 --> 01:35:58.458
You did?

01:35:58.708 --> 01:35:59.583
Who's that?

01:35:59.750 --> 01:36:00.625
25th Anniversary?

01:36:00.708 --> 01:36:01.583
THURSDAY

01:36:01.833 --> 01:36:03.458
-Nice card.
-I designed it, sir.

01:36:03.541 --> 01:36:05.125
But I can't make it.
I'm going to Delhi.

01:36:05.250 --> 01:36:07.083
Sir, he'll explain
the agenda in two minutes.

01:36:07.208 --> 01:36:09.583
I'm going to the temple.
I'll see you in the evening.

01:36:09.708 --> 01:36:11.291
-He's going to the temple.
-He's saying evening.

01:36:11.375 --> 01:36:12.333
Sir!

01:36:13.416 --> 01:36:14.333
You don't come.

01:36:15.208 --> 01:36:18.166
But please listen to the
speech I prepared for you.

01:36:18.625 --> 01:36:19.958
It's up to you to go to Delhi or not.

01:36:20.125 --> 01:36:22.583
Once you hear the speech,
you'll never go to Delhi again.

01:36:23.708 --> 01:36:24.750
Costly flowers, sir.

01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:29.500
Ma'am, give me two rupees, please.
You're so beautiful.

01:36:32.875 --> 01:36:34.500
Ma'am! God will bless you.

01:36:34.666 --> 01:36:35.750
Hey!

01:36:40.625 --> 01:36:41.541
Thank you, sir.

01:36:42.916 --> 01:36:44.125
Why did you give 500 rupees, sir?

01:36:44.208 --> 01:36:47.208
Our work gets done quickly when
we do such things once in a while.

01:36:53.750 --> 01:36:56.083
Sir, the prayer is almost done.
I don't think he's coming.

01:36:58.250 --> 01:36:59.375
Greetings, sir.

01:37:07.708 --> 01:37:08.750
Go.

01:37:08.958 --> 01:37:10.000
Go!

01:37:11.791 --> 01:37:13.208
-Find out what happened.
-Sir.

01:37:16.500 --> 01:37:17.666
-Nice.
-Thank you, sir.

01:37:17.875 --> 01:37:20.333
What was that? It's selfish of me…

01:37:20.416 --> 01:37:22.708
to wish for your wellness
when I'm in power.

01:37:22.833 --> 01:37:23.708
FRIDAY

01:37:23.791 --> 01:37:26.875
But it's my responsibility to wish for
your wellness even when I'm not in power.

01:37:27.333 --> 01:37:30.583
He postponed his Delhi
trip to next Monday for this.

01:37:31.208 --> 01:37:33.416
Our only option now is this Saturday.

01:37:37.958 --> 01:37:38.833
Saturday.

01:37:50.333 --> 01:37:52.666
If we miss him at the temple,
what can we do at the bar that night?

01:37:53.083 --> 01:37:55.125
This is our only chance, Surya.

01:37:55.875 --> 01:37:57.166
If we miss this…

01:38:02.166 --> 01:38:03.250
We won't miss it!

01:38:04.833 --> 01:38:06.166
I won't let it happen.

01:38:16.666 --> 01:38:20.208
SATURDAY

01:38:27.958 --> 01:38:28.875
Hey, Kali…

01:38:29.291 --> 01:38:31.291
Your father was doing
well when you were here.

01:38:32.083 --> 01:38:33.500
Some guy Surya…

01:38:33.916 --> 01:38:35.666
He got me so worked up.

01:38:36.958 --> 01:38:38.291
Don't spare him!

01:38:58.041 --> 01:38:59.458
Inspector…

01:39:14.833 --> 01:39:15.916
-Yes, uncle?
-Listen.

01:39:16.291 --> 01:39:19.583
-Who's Inspector Daya?
-He's a psycho case. Why?

01:39:19.666 --> 01:39:21.833
This madman has written down his name.

01:39:22.750 --> 01:39:24.125
I don't know what to do.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:28.041
Should I go tell Daya
that he's coming to hit him?

01:39:28.166 --> 01:39:29.916
And ask him to be careful, maybe?

01:39:30.166 --> 01:39:33.375
Will you warn a cop that
your son is going to hit him?

01:39:33.916 --> 01:39:35.166
What do you want me to do then?

01:39:36.666 --> 01:39:37.541
Uncle…

01:39:50.666 --> 01:39:51.583
Dear…

01:39:51.791 --> 01:39:52.833
drink this.

01:39:58.875 --> 01:40:00.958
-Sudha.
-Sir, he's on the way.

01:40:07.791 --> 01:40:09.208
Go, go.

01:40:24.208 --> 01:40:25.083
Dear…

01:40:43.833 --> 01:40:45.208
"Daya started!"

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:48.125
Dad…

01:40:48.583 --> 01:40:49.458
Dad what?

01:40:50.416 --> 01:40:51.500
Go back to sleep.

01:41:04.833 --> 01:41:10.583
I told you to tell me when
someone messes with Dad.

01:41:11.250 --> 01:41:12.166
So?

01:41:12.916 --> 01:41:14.583
Who the hell is Surya?

01:41:23.875 --> 01:41:25.250
Where's Surya?

01:41:25.416 --> 01:41:26.333
-Where is he?
-Surya…

01:41:27.750 --> 01:41:28.875
Come here. Come.

01:41:30.083 --> 01:41:31.500
Why did you get a gang?
Shooting something?

01:41:32.291 --> 01:41:33.625
Where's Surya?

01:41:34.333 --> 01:41:35.208
What day is it today?

01:41:35.708 --> 01:41:36.625
Saturday.

01:41:36.791 --> 01:41:38.375
He doesn't come to work
even on my orders.

01:41:38.458 --> 01:41:39.750
Do you think he'll show up for you?

01:41:40.916 --> 01:41:42.041
What's that scar on the face?

01:41:42.666 --> 01:41:44.083
We have a special policy for that.

01:41:44.791 --> 01:41:45.833
Come.

01:41:47.750 --> 01:41:49.000
Where's Surya?

01:41:49.583 --> 01:41:50.583
I don't know.

01:41:52.208 --> 01:41:54.875
Scoot the knife back a little.
I don't have an insurance policy.

01:42:01.416 --> 01:42:03.333
-Yes?
-Narayana Prabha is dead.

01:42:03.708 --> 01:42:05.166
His men are looking for Surya.

01:42:05.291 --> 01:42:06.250
They shouldn't find him.

01:42:06.375 --> 01:42:07.333
Hey!

01:42:07.583 --> 01:42:08.833
He has fallen asleep.

01:42:09.166 --> 01:42:11.041
-What do you want me to do?
-How can I tell you?

01:42:11.791 --> 01:42:13.375
They'll be coming home. Do something.

01:42:13.708 --> 01:42:14.666
Okay, hang up!

01:42:16.166 --> 01:42:17.625
Him and his stupid ideas!

01:42:19.916 --> 01:42:22.041
Surya… Surya…

01:42:22.333 --> 01:42:23.416
Wake up!

01:42:56.958 --> 01:42:58.375
Dad…

01:42:59.833 --> 01:43:01.208
Dad…

01:43:33.083 --> 01:43:35.625
-Hey! You're supposed to watch the road!
-Sorry, sir.

01:43:35.750 --> 01:43:36.666
Start the car!

01:43:38.875 --> 01:43:40.083
Sir, he's at the temple.

01:43:40.166 --> 01:43:41.125
Where are you?

01:43:44.791 --> 01:43:45.708
Start the vehicle!

01:43:46.458 --> 01:43:48.708
Sir, sir, sir…
I'm trying!

01:43:48.833 --> 01:43:50.875
-Hey, auto! Stop, stop!
-Sir!

01:43:51.666 --> 01:43:52.750
Take me to the Balaji temple.

01:43:52.833 --> 01:43:54.666
I have to pick the school kids.
Who are you, sir?

01:43:54.833 --> 01:43:56.416
Do as I say. Go!

01:44:00.500 --> 01:44:01.458
Go fast!

01:44:03.208 --> 01:44:05.291
Sir, he's leaving! Come fast!

01:44:05.916 --> 01:44:07.791
I'm coming, Sudha! I'm coming!

01:44:07.875 --> 01:44:08.958
I'm coming, Sudha!

01:44:11.125 --> 01:44:13.166
Uncle, can you please move?

01:44:13.333 --> 01:44:14.958
Hey! I'll punch you! Move!

01:44:15.375 --> 01:44:16.291
Stop!

01:44:24.375 --> 01:44:26.291
Bro, nobody knows.

01:44:27.083 --> 01:44:28.791
Where else did you see him?

01:44:35.333 --> 01:44:37.291
You should've come a little sooner.

01:44:38.166 --> 01:44:40.583
The pub is our last hope.

01:44:40.833 --> 01:44:41.708
But…

01:44:48.750 --> 01:44:49.958
Our car is starting, sir.

01:44:50.625 --> 01:44:51.541
You…

01:44:52.791 --> 01:44:53.750
Get the keys.

01:44:56.375 --> 01:44:57.250
Go!

01:44:57.583 --> 01:44:58.458
Go! Go!

01:44:58.666 --> 01:45:00.791
The pub is our last option, sir.

01:45:01.125 --> 01:45:04.625
But it's difficult to get
through the security and go in.

01:45:21.333 --> 01:45:23.583
You should be really
careful in the next two to three weeks.

01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:25.083
Is none of your family here?

01:45:25.916 --> 01:45:27.125
Think about it.

01:45:27.958 --> 01:45:29.125
Forget about your brother.

01:45:29.833 --> 01:45:31.333
At least tell your dad.

01:45:32.125 --> 01:45:33.125
Do you understand me?

01:45:47.041 --> 01:45:50.000
Someone said there's going to
be a miraculous change soon.

01:45:50.333 --> 01:45:51.250
What happened?

01:45:52.291 --> 01:45:53.916
Nobody here has the guts, Uncle.

01:45:54.750 --> 01:45:57.041
Listen to me. Don't be delusional.

01:45:57.416 --> 01:45:59.083
Saturday and change, my foot!

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:10.000
I guess he's here.

01:46:13.291 --> 01:46:14.375
It's some woman.

01:46:14.791 --> 01:46:15.958
Should we tell her the house is locked?

01:46:17.208 --> 01:46:18.791
Why? Can't she see for herself?

01:46:30.333 --> 01:46:32.250
-Hello.
-Hello, Dad. Where are you?

01:46:32.458 --> 01:46:33.541
The front door is locked.

01:46:34.500 --> 01:46:36.250
-Wait, are you here?
-Yeah.

01:46:36.875 --> 01:46:38.458
What are you doing
here at this time?

01:46:38.791 --> 01:46:39.750
What happened, Dad?

01:46:39.833 --> 01:46:41.916
It's your brother's usual mess.

01:46:42.083 --> 01:46:43.041
No, what happened?

01:46:43.333 --> 01:46:45.000
-Is nobody outside?
-No.

01:46:45.666 --> 01:46:48.250
-Enter from the back door.
-So you're inside?

01:46:48.333 --> 01:46:50.416
Just come in. I'll explain later.

01:46:50.583 --> 01:46:52.125
Okay, okay. I'm coming.

01:47:00.291 --> 01:47:01.333
You're pregnant?

01:47:03.125 --> 01:47:05.041
What is she doing in front of
a locked house for so long?

01:47:07.458 --> 01:47:09.583
Why did you keep it from me
when it was him you fought with?

01:47:09.708 --> 01:47:10.875
Why did you show up now?

01:47:11.166 --> 01:47:12.916
You should've directly come with the baby.

01:47:13.208 --> 01:47:15.666
Bangalore, Mattigadda,
were all lies, right?

01:47:15.750 --> 01:47:17.541
-Dad…
-Don't talk to me!

01:47:17.875 --> 01:47:18.916
You're no different from him.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:24.583
-How did you come?
-In my car.

01:47:24.750 --> 01:47:26.291
Bloody car! Where did you park it?

01:47:26.500 --> 01:47:27.375
Outside.

01:47:28.375 --> 01:47:29.625
Outside--

01:47:32.041 --> 01:47:33.083
What happened, Dad?

01:47:36.416 --> 01:47:37.333
Hey!

01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:39.041
This guy is home!

01:47:44.958 --> 01:47:46.625
Surya… Surya…

01:47:49.666 --> 01:47:50.708
Surya, wake up!

01:48:24.916 --> 01:48:25.833
Stop!

01:48:28.166 --> 01:48:29.166
Surya…

01:48:34.291 --> 01:48:35.208
Surya…

01:48:45.583 --> 01:48:46.541
Surya!

01:48:47.958 --> 01:48:50.333
Do you know what true anger means?

01:49:00.833 --> 01:49:01.916
Surya!

01:49:02.958 --> 01:49:03.916
Surya!

01:49:05.083 --> 01:49:06.375
Kill him, guys!

01:49:13.916 --> 01:49:14.833
Chinnu…

01:50:54.875 --> 01:50:55.958
Why didn't you tell me?

01:50:58.541 --> 01:50:59.958
Am I a stranger to you now?

01:52:07.375 --> 01:52:08.458
Hey!

01:52:17.750 --> 01:52:19.125
Bhadra! What happened, dear?

01:52:52.875 --> 01:52:53.750
Surya!

01:52:54.083 --> 01:52:54.958
Surya!

01:53:10.541 --> 01:53:11.958
-Careful, dear.
-Come.

01:53:50.583 --> 01:53:51.666
Come and get her.

01:55:48.541 --> 01:55:51.541
My father fell under a running
train and passed away, sir.

01:55:52.250 --> 01:55:56.541
That is why I like to set
every clock ten minutes ahead.

01:56:25.875 --> 01:56:26.750
Hey!

01:56:38.541 --> 01:56:42.375
We just have to let Kurma
know that Daya is trying to kill him.

01:56:42.458 --> 01:56:44.125
Kurma will handle Daya.

01:58:28.041 --> 01:58:31.333
Hey! Come, come.

01:58:31.958 --> 01:58:32.833
Come!

01:58:33.125 --> 01:58:34.625
He hit Daya!

01:58:34.791 --> 01:58:37.333
One of us hit Daya, Uncle.

01:58:39.333 --> 01:58:41.083
He wore a mask and hit him!

01:58:44.916 --> 01:58:46.458
Missed by an inch!

01:58:48.708 --> 01:58:49.916
My brother…

01:58:51.208 --> 01:58:53.000
Your brother's men
would be looking for us, sir.

01:58:53.291 --> 01:58:55.041
I'll find a hideout for us.

01:58:57.208 --> 01:58:58.541
My brother tried to…

01:59:00.166 --> 01:59:02.083
One of us hit him!

01:59:03.791 --> 01:59:05.708
Somebody hit our CI?

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:17.125
Find him!

01:59:23.625 --> 01:59:26.291
Say it, Dad.
Tell me that nothing happened.

01:59:27.166 --> 01:59:30.583
You asked me why I kept
my pregnancy from you, right?

01:59:31.125 --> 01:59:33.416
If I did, I wouldn't have
made it to the ninth month.

01:59:35.458 --> 01:59:39.208
When a guy like him is in the
family, why would I tell you?

01:59:40.625 --> 01:59:41.666
One last thing, Dad.

01:59:42.375 --> 01:59:44.083
If you want me to live with you…

01:59:44.458 --> 01:59:48.458
he should give up his Saturday fights.

01:59:50.958 --> 01:59:54.166
I don't care if you think
of this as blackmail.

01:59:55.791 --> 01:59:57.500
He said whether it's a baby boy or a girl,

01:59:58.208 --> 01:59:59.333
it's Mom coming back to us.

02:00:00.500 --> 02:00:02.458
Ask him if he can
do it for Mom at least.

02:00:10.583 --> 02:00:13.916
Light that guides through the darkness

02:00:14.125 --> 02:00:17.583
Awakening the dawn

02:00:17.791 --> 02:00:24.666
With every step
Are you moving forward or just beginning?

02:00:25.083 --> 02:00:28.333
It's just a caterpillar during origin

02:00:28.666 --> 02:00:32.125
And then it transforms into a butterfly

02:00:32.333 --> 02:00:38.708
Have the patience to grow wings

02:00:45.750 --> 02:00:48.500
Why do I feel like he's
the one who hit Daya?

02:00:48.833 --> 02:00:50.125
-What? Him?
-Yes.

02:00:50.833 --> 02:00:51.750
Look properly!

02:00:52.666 --> 02:00:53.666
You think so?

02:00:55.666 --> 02:00:57.166
Look how he's squeezing the garments.

02:00:57.375 --> 02:00:59.500
I have a feeling it's him who hit Daya.

02:00:59.708 --> 02:01:00.708
It's strange, Uncle.

02:01:01.375 --> 02:01:04.041
Whoever I see is giving me
the feeling that they hit Daya.

02:01:04.208 --> 02:01:05.291
Namaste, Uncle.

02:01:05.541 --> 02:01:07.125
You also look like that to me.

02:01:07.500 --> 02:01:12.541
What lies in which path?

02:01:12.791 --> 02:01:15.583
You and Dad should
take care of your sister.

02:01:17.458 --> 02:01:19.166
What? Where are you going?

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:21.833
I need to go now to
come back to you, right?

02:01:23.250 --> 02:01:28.750
Unknowingly, it is revealing something

02:01:30.541 --> 02:01:37.500
Is it showing some destination?

02:01:37.833 --> 02:01:41.875
Words that cannot be crossed
And mistakes that cannot be corrected

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:45.500
As you try to change that
The path changes

02:01:45.583 --> 02:01:49.208
Fate gives it to you with companionship

02:01:49.416 --> 02:01:52.833
A game played without being seen

02:02:10.333 --> 02:02:12.958
-What now? Should I thank you?
-I didn't ask you to.

02:02:13.625 --> 02:02:15.041
I won't thank you even if you ask.

02:02:15.666 --> 02:02:16.541
Thanks.

02:02:17.291 --> 02:02:19.416
I have the doctor's appointment tomorrow.

02:02:19.833 --> 02:02:20.833
Can you take me?

02:02:23.250 --> 02:02:30.083
A wave is less intimidating
When you dive deep

02:02:30.541 --> 02:02:36.916
It's okay to listen to your heart
It doesn't make you small

02:02:37.125 --> 02:02:39.875
Time is an illusion

02:02:40.625 --> 02:02:43.500
Is it going to lead the way?

02:02:44.166 --> 02:02:47.333
The silence within you

02:02:47.541 --> 02:02:50.333
Fills a bundle of hope

02:02:50.541 --> 02:02:56.416
A turn has come, oh a turn has come

02:02:57.666 --> 02:03:00.500
Where will this turn lead?

02:03:01.416 --> 02:03:05.166
A turn has come, oh a turn has come

02:03:27.458 --> 02:03:29.708
HIDE AND SEEK

02:03:51.125 --> 02:03:52.125
Why?

02:03:54.083 --> 02:03:55.250
Why did you do it?

02:03:56.708 --> 02:03:57.958
What have I done to you?

02:03:59.791 --> 02:04:01.500
Was it for insulting you at
my house the other day?

02:04:02.125 --> 02:04:05.250
Or for making you go in circles around
me for that piece of land? Why?

02:04:10.541 --> 02:04:11.916
Why did you save me?

02:04:14.083 --> 02:04:15.083
Tell me.

02:04:22.500 --> 02:04:24.625
Did I ever treat you like my brother?

02:04:25.541 --> 02:04:26.416
Never.

02:04:28.083 --> 02:04:30.250
Why do you love this mad person so much?

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:32.000
What have I done?

02:04:33.625 --> 02:04:35.458
You got yourself hurt.

02:04:36.250 --> 02:04:37.125
Why?

02:04:39.125 --> 02:04:41.250
We may have a lot of differences.

02:04:42.333 --> 02:04:43.458
But you're my big brother.

02:04:45.208 --> 02:04:46.416
Nobody can change that.

02:04:50.541 --> 02:04:52.000
Sir, coffee, tea.

02:04:53.458 --> 02:04:54.333
Sir.

02:04:54.416 --> 02:04:55.291
Here…

02:04:55.666 --> 02:04:56.750
-Water bottle, sir.
-Coffee--

02:04:57.958 --> 02:04:58.958
Have it.

02:05:00.291 --> 02:05:01.208
Have it.

02:05:09.375 --> 02:05:11.791
You see how much
my brother loves me, Govi?

02:05:12.166 --> 02:05:13.458
I've known since day one.

02:05:13.875 --> 02:05:15.500
He let me go that day
before you called him.

02:05:16.333 --> 02:05:18.666
You've always misunderstood him.

02:05:19.333 --> 02:05:22.041
Wrong judgment!

02:05:22.250 --> 02:05:24.083
I kept you away
for so long because of it.

02:05:24.250 --> 02:05:26.250
But this will never
happen again. I promise.

02:05:26.458 --> 02:05:28.708
If he went to such lengths
to save you, why did he hide?

02:05:31.041 --> 02:05:32.125
For me…

02:05:33.375 --> 02:05:35.250
what's more important than
living with my brother…

02:05:36.458 --> 02:05:37.791
is his being alive.

02:05:38.208 --> 02:05:40.833
Your answer has nothing
to do with what I asked.

02:05:41.166 --> 02:05:46.750
You all kept me and my brother
away for so long with this attitude.

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:52.416
You're so doubtful, you would've
mistaken me for the killer.

02:05:55.791 --> 02:05:57.500
-Water.
-Bro, it's not like that.

02:05:57.625 --> 02:05:59.250
Shut up, you rascal!

02:05:59.875 --> 02:06:01.500
You and your bloody doubts!

02:06:01.750 --> 02:06:03.666
You moron! Just shut your mouth!

02:06:05.250 --> 02:06:06.208
You take it.

02:06:07.541 --> 02:06:10.333
Take this house, the land,
everything. I don't want it.

02:06:11.666 --> 02:06:12.541
Take it.

02:06:13.958 --> 02:06:14.875
Brother…

02:06:17.375 --> 02:06:18.333
What did you say?

02:06:19.166 --> 02:06:20.166
Brother…

02:06:21.750 --> 02:06:22.625
Brother.

02:06:25.166 --> 02:06:28.083
This is enough for a lifetime.
My brother saved me.

02:06:28.958 --> 02:06:30.000
This is enough for me.

02:06:31.250 --> 02:06:32.291
Hey! Don't cry!

02:06:35.375 --> 02:06:36.875
I want one thing though.

02:06:41.333 --> 02:06:44.250
The guy who's been trying to kill me.

02:06:45.625 --> 02:06:48.583
The guy who hurt my
brother who came to save me.

02:06:51.791 --> 02:06:53.208
Don't spare him!

02:06:54.916 --> 02:06:56.541
I won't, brother!

02:06:57.583 --> 02:06:59.125
I won't spare him, for your sake.

02:07:17.166 --> 02:07:18.250
How is…

02:07:19.041 --> 02:07:19.916
everyone?

02:07:22.916 --> 02:07:25.458
Surya, it didn't turn out as we planned.

02:07:25.833 --> 02:07:27.125
I don't get it.

02:07:27.291 --> 02:07:29.291
Both of them are looking for you now.

02:07:30.250 --> 02:07:32.083
Anything might happen at any time.

02:07:33.375 --> 02:07:34.708
You also said your sister is pregnant.

02:07:35.250 --> 02:07:36.416
Let's not risk it.

02:07:37.416 --> 02:07:38.541
Listen to me.

02:07:39.166 --> 02:07:41.750
-Leave town urgently.
-And?

02:07:43.166 --> 02:07:44.708
They won't spare me
anyway once they identify me.

02:07:45.250 --> 02:07:46.916
What were you planning on doing then?

02:07:48.333 --> 02:07:49.666
Whoever that guy is,

02:07:49.833 --> 02:07:51.791
in a way he helped us a lot, sir.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:53.041
Even if we don't find him,

02:07:53.166 --> 02:07:56.125
we could take a phony to
your brother in his place.

02:07:56.250 --> 02:07:58.250
We'll hit the jackpot, sir.

02:08:03.500 --> 02:08:05.083
Why didn't I think of this?

02:08:06.541 --> 02:08:08.083
-What was that?
-Jackpot, sir.

02:08:14.541 --> 02:08:16.250
-How does it feel?
-It hurts, sir.

02:08:16.875 --> 02:08:17.958
It hurts like hell, sir.

02:08:24.166 --> 02:08:26.333
Wipe it. Here you go.

02:08:27.250 --> 02:08:30.416
-Did the pain go down?
-No, sir. No.

02:08:30.916 --> 02:08:33.416
Money doesn't heal the pain, does it?

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:34.875
No, sir.

02:08:34.958 --> 02:08:36.208
Then how will I…

02:08:37.333 --> 02:08:39.000
He hit me, Sudha.

02:08:40.166 --> 02:08:42.708
And you say he helped us?!

02:08:53.166 --> 02:08:55.750
He raised his hand.

02:08:57.083 --> 02:08:58.583
He was about to punch me.

02:09:00.208 --> 02:09:01.125
But then he stopped.

02:09:02.041 --> 02:09:02.916
Walked away.

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:06.500
Came back and punched me this time.

02:09:07.333 --> 02:09:10.041
Why did he stop the first time?

02:09:10.708 --> 02:09:12.500
Why did he come back and punch me?

02:09:16.500 --> 02:09:17.916
What happened in the meantime?

02:09:24.375 --> 02:09:25.291
Hey!

02:09:34.250 --> 02:09:35.666
What has he done?

02:09:36.250 --> 02:09:42.250
There's some connection between
the clock and landing the punch.

02:09:43.875 --> 02:09:47.750
There's some connection between
the clock and landing the punch.

02:09:47.833 --> 02:09:49.333
-We need to find out.
-I'll figure it out, sir.

02:09:54.875 --> 02:09:56.291
-So, you checked it.
-Sir.

02:09:58.041 --> 02:10:01.416
The clock is ten minutes ahead.

02:10:01.583 --> 02:10:02.458
Sir.

02:10:03.125 --> 02:10:04.958
So what if it's ten minutes ahead?

02:10:06.708 --> 02:10:08.125
-Sir… I don't know.
-You don't know?

02:10:12.083 --> 02:10:13.666
He didn't know either.

02:10:14.625 --> 02:10:16.250
He assumed the clock
struck twelve and stopped.

02:10:17.375 --> 02:10:19.125
When he found out,
he came back to punch me.

02:10:19.708 --> 02:10:22.041
So what if the clock struck twelve?

02:10:22.875 --> 02:10:25.083
The day just changed, sir.

02:10:25.375 --> 02:10:29.208
It's a Sunday then.

02:10:30.083 --> 02:10:31.625
So he doesn't hit on Sundays?

02:10:32.541 --> 02:10:33.541
Who would be so weird, sir?

02:10:33.625 --> 02:10:36.083
I'm sure he's capable of that.

02:10:38.166 --> 02:10:39.666
Who is it, Sudha?

02:10:43.791 --> 02:10:45.875
The guy who hit you
also wore a mask, right?

02:10:46.583 --> 02:10:48.375
He put a mask on me and hit me, sir.

02:10:48.583 --> 02:10:51.041
Whatever! He hit you, right?

02:10:51.125 --> 02:10:52.333
-Yes, sir.
-What day was it?

02:10:52.708 --> 02:10:54.208
I think it's on 25th…

02:10:54.333 --> 02:10:55.833
Enough of your English!
I'll break your jaw!

02:10:56.125 --> 02:10:57.041
What day was it?

02:10:57.416 --> 02:11:00.625
-Friday or Saturday… It was the…
-Twenty…

02:11:00.750 --> 02:11:02.791
-It was the 24th.
-Saturday!

02:11:03.750 --> 02:11:04.750
Absolutely, sir.

02:11:04.875 --> 02:11:06.125
Saturday.

02:11:09.500 --> 02:11:14.250
He hit the both of us on a Saturday.

02:11:16.041 --> 02:11:17.791
There are two possibilities, Sudha.

02:11:19.916 --> 02:11:23.541
He either stays under
the radar on Sundays…

02:11:23.625 --> 02:11:27.458
and goes all out from Monday to Saturday.

02:11:27.625 --> 02:11:28.541
Or…

02:11:31.416 --> 02:11:34.000
He goes all out only on Saturdays.

02:11:36.458 --> 02:11:38.708
-Now it makes sense, Sudha.
-Sir…

02:11:40.625 --> 02:11:45.500
I want details about FIRs filed
on Saturdays in all the stations.

02:11:45.583 --> 02:11:46.500
Okay, sir.

02:11:51.791 --> 02:11:53.166
It's enough indeed.

02:11:54.333 --> 02:11:55.666
Saturday is enough.

02:12:04.916 --> 02:12:07.291
Sir, I inquired everywhere.

02:12:07.500 --> 02:12:09.125
No complaint has been registered.

02:12:09.458 --> 02:12:11.458
But there was one
complaint at the last station.

02:12:12.583 --> 02:12:14.000
-When?
-Just now.

02:12:36.500 --> 02:12:37.416
Sir.

02:12:43.625 --> 02:12:44.625
Hey!

02:12:45.375 --> 02:12:46.375
What are you looking at?

02:12:48.625 --> 02:12:49.541
Sir.

02:12:50.583 --> 02:12:51.500
Tell me.

02:12:52.416 --> 02:12:53.333
My name is Surya, sir.

02:12:53.708 --> 02:12:56.458
-A guy hit me. I want to file…
-Who hit you?

02:12:57.625 --> 02:12:58.666
I don't know, sir.

02:12:59.833 --> 02:13:02.583
I don't know.
Sir, sir, sir.

02:13:05.083 --> 02:13:06.625
When? Which day was it?

02:13:07.833 --> 02:13:08.916
Last Saturday, sir.

02:13:09.875 --> 02:13:10.791
Time?

02:13:11.291 --> 02:13:14.750
Around 10:30 p.m. when
I was returning from work.

02:13:14.875 --> 02:13:17.500
-Where do you work?
-NLIC, sir.

02:13:17.666 --> 02:13:18.666
NLIC.

02:13:19.375 --> 02:13:20.958
-Government employee?
-Yes, sir.

02:13:21.625 --> 02:13:22.666
ID?

02:13:25.833 --> 02:13:26.875
Sir.

02:13:30.875 --> 02:13:32.125
-Sudha, check it.
-Sir.

02:13:34.250 --> 02:13:35.333
-Date?
-Check it.

02:13:36.500 --> 02:13:38.958
-Sir?
-The date when he hit you.

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:41.708
The date was…

02:13:42.500 --> 02:13:44.625
Twenty-second…

02:13:48.333 --> 02:13:49.291
What?

02:13:49.541 --> 02:13:50.583
Twenty-second.

02:13:51.041 --> 02:13:52.000
Twenty-second?

02:13:54.250 --> 02:13:55.500
Twenty-second?

02:13:56.125 --> 02:13:57.166
Twenty-second?

02:13:59.750 --> 02:14:02.958
-Sudha, I got him. Open the cell.
-Sir…

02:14:03.041 --> 02:14:04.041
Hey!

02:14:04.791 --> 02:14:05.666
Open the cell.

02:14:05.750 --> 02:14:07.750
Twenty-second is a government holiday.

02:14:07.875 --> 02:14:10.125
-Not a working day.
-Sir, sir, sir.

02:14:10.250 --> 02:14:12.750
-Sir, hear me out.
-Get in!

02:14:13.333 --> 02:14:14.625
-Hey!
-Sir, please! No!

02:14:30.958 --> 02:14:32.208
Sir, please, sir!

02:14:36.083 --> 02:14:37.125
It's not him.

02:14:37.666 --> 02:14:41.458
I assumed he must've put
his criminal mind to use…

02:14:41.541 --> 02:14:43.916
by hitting me and then
going on to file a complaint.

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:48.083
All this in the hopes of protecting
himself from me, I thought.

02:14:50.083 --> 02:14:51.708
But he's not that smart.

02:14:58.166 --> 02:14:59.041
Su…

02:14:59.125 --> 02:15:00.125
-Surya.
-Surya…

02:15:00.875 --> 02:15:05.708
Was he wearing the mask
or did he force one on you?

02:15:07.041 --> 02:15:08.458
He was wearing the mask, sir.

02:15:08.833 --> 02:15:09.750
How do you know?

02:15:11.750 --> 02:15:12.791
How do I know?

02:15:14.541 --> 02:15:15.833
How do I know?

02:15:18.750 --> 02:15:20.750
You also got hit.
What are you laughing at, idiot?

02:15:29.333 --> 02:15:31.041
I feel like I've seen you somewhere.

02:15:32.375 --> 02:15:35.250
I told you about the petrol
leak at the hospital, sir.

02:15:36.666 --> 02:15:37.916
-GH?
-Yes, sir.

02:15:39.833 --> 02:15:42.416
-Sudha, do you remember him?
-Yes, sir.

02:15:42.500 --> 02:15:43.666
Then why didn't you say so?

02:15:45.291 --> 02:15:47.666
Surya, thank you.
Come, sit.

02:15:49.500 --> 02:15:51.833
Surya, let's be open.

02:15:52.791 --> 02:15:56.500
-Sir.
-The guy who hit you, him…

02:15:58.666 --> 02:16:00.041
and me…

02:16:01.625 --> 02:16:02.791
is the same person.

02:16:03.208 --> 02:16:04.291
He hit you?!

02:16:04.375 --> 02:16:06.625
Don't be so shocked. That's the truth.

02:16:07.375 --> 02:16:08.875
-Surya.
-Sir.

02:16:09.166 --> 02:16:12.125
Surya, I couldn't see
his face in the dark.

02:16:12.625 --> 02:16:17.041
Did you see anything to help identify him?

02:16:18.375 --> 02:16:20.541
I tried my best to see his face, sir.

02:16:21.958 --> 02:16:23.625
I can recognize his eyes though.

02:16:24.125 --> 02:16:25.166
-Confirm?
-Yes, sir.

02:16:25.291 --> 02:16:30.583
Sudha, whoever fits the description
in that age group, get them.

02:16:31.416 --> 02:16:32.958
-We should definitely get him!
-Yes!

02:16:36.125 --> 02:16:41.250
Surya, usually I hit
people without a reason.

02:16:41.708 --> 02:16:43.875
But a guy hit me without reason.

02:16:44.041 --> 02:16:45.000
Will I spare him?

02:16:46.541 --> 02:16:47.916
Wait and watch.

02:16:48.458 --> 02:16:49.583
I will…

02:16:51.458 --> 02:16:55.583
You know what I'll do to
his family in front of his eyes?

02:16:57.791 --> 02:16:58.791
I won't tell you.

02:16:59.625 --> 02:17:02.375
Because I don't know what I'm going to do.

02:17:04.375 --> 02:17:06.041
-Charulatha!
-Sir.

02:17:06.166 --> 02:17:07.416
Take his details.

02:17:08.083 --> 02:17:09.083
Come, Surya.

02:17:09.958 --> 02:17:13.708
I've seen people who don't eat
non-veg or drink on Saturdays.

02:17:14.458 --> 02:17:16.666
What's with hitting and killing people?

02:17:18.333 --> 02:17:19.833
Do you think it's some sort of worship?

02:17:21.958 --> 02:17:24.375
We've identified ten men
in the same age group.

02:17:24.666 --> 02:17:26.125
Call the NLIC guy.

02:17:27.375 --> 02:17:28.333
Sir.

02:17:28.666 --> 02:17:30.916
You took his number, right? Call him!

02:17:38.583 --> 02:17:39.583
No, sir.

02:17:45.125 --> 02:17:46.041
Bottle Cap?

02:17:48.541 --> 02:17:49.541
Why does it say "Bottle Cap"?

02:17:51.875 --> 02:17:55.291
His face looks a little like a bottle cap.

02:18:00.166 --> 02:18:01.625
You don't give it away.

02:18:01.833 --> 02:18:03.500
But you're very naughty.

02:18:08.708 --> 02:18:09.875
Hello.

02:18:11.291 --> 02:18:12.833
Don't say Charu. Don't say Charu.

02:18:15.833 --> 02:18:16.750
Please.

02:18:16.958 --> 02:18:17.916
Hello, Charulatha ma'am.

02:18:20.291 --> 02:18:22.541
Brother, Daya here.

02:18:24.166 --> 02:18:25.083
No, sir.

02:18:30.500 --> 02:18:31.666
No, sir.

02:18:39.833 --> 02:18:40.875
Well…

02:18:41.666 --> 02:18:44.375
where was I supposed to be on
the Saturday he tried to kill me?

02:18:45.500 --> 02:18:46.541
Delhi, sir.

02:19:09.125 --> 02:19:10.000
Sir.

02:19:13.333 --> 02:19:14.250
We found him!

02:19:25.125 --> 02:19:26.041
Hello.

02:19:26.416 --> 02:19:29.541
I found a guy here.
I have a feeling it's him.

02:19:30.291 --> 02:19:31.333
You found the guy?

02:19:31.625 --> 02:19:32.791
Why? Did you also find the guy?

02:19:33.041 --> 02:19:35.000
I don't know if the guy
you found is the guy.

02:19:35.083 --> 02:19:36.791
But the guy I found is definitely the guy.

02:19:37.500 --> 02:19:39.916
-Come, we'll talk.
-Coming, brother.

02:19:42.416 --> 02:19:44.833
Your brother seems to be real fast, sir.

02:19:49.541 --> 02:19:50.708
Come, dear.

02:19:51.291 --> 02:19:52.458
He's the guy.

02:19:52.791 --> 02:19:53.916
I'll handle him.

02:20:02.333 --> 02:20:04.250
Hey, Surya!

02:20:04.791 --> 02:20:05.708
What?

02:20:06.208 --> 02:20:07.250
Get up!

02:20:07.333 --> 02:20:08.875
Hey, you know him?

02:20:08.958 --> 02:20:11.125
-Don't be silly, brother.
-No, it's him!

02:20:11.291 --> 02:20:14.250
-It's not him.
-I'm telling you, it's him!

02:20:14.333 --> 02:20:17.916
-Trust me, it's not him.
-Oh, dear! Please believe me.

02:20:18.083 --> 02:20:20.125
I thought really hard
and got hold of him.

02:20:20.458 --> 02:20:22.541
My judgment says he's the guy.

02:20:22.791 --> 02:20:23.666
Foolish judgment.

02:20:24.208 --> 02:20:27.708
He's also a victim of the
Saturday guy just like us.

02:20:28.166 --> 02:20:30.625
In fact, only he has sort of seen him.

02:20:31.500 --> 02:20:32.875
We found the actual guy.

02:20:34.041 --> 02:20:35.750
He should take a look and confirm it.

02:20:36.583 --> 02:20:37.458
You found him?

02:20:38.083 --> 02:20:39.625
-Sudha!
-Sir.

02:20:40.416 --> 02:20:41.333
What's this?

02:20:41.958 --> 02:20:42.916
Sorry, Surya.

02:20:44.625 --> 02:20:45.666
Sir, the real guy…

02:20:46.666 --> 02:20:47.625
Take a look.

02:20:47.708 --> 02:20:48.875
What is this?

02:20:52.041 --> 02:20:53.583
He's one of the Sokulapalem guys.

02:20:54.750 --> 02:20:56.000
He wrote a message on the wall.

02:20:59.625 --> 02:21:00.541
Is this him?

02:21:00.750 --> 02:21:01.666
Let me go, sir!

02:21:01.791 --> 02:21:02.791
No, sir.

02:21:06.166 --> 02:21:07.166
No, sir.

02:21:08.625 --> 02:21:09.708
-Is this him?
-No, sir.

02:21:10.041 --> 02:21:11.958
-Is this him?
-No, sir.

02:21:13.750 --> 02:21:14.708
Is that him?

02:21:21.500 --> 02:21:22.666
Surya, look properly!

02:21:47.666 --> 02:21:48.583
Kill them!

02:21:51.791 --> 02:21:52.750
Is it him?

02:21:53.250 --> 02:21:54.500
-Is it him?
-No, sir.

02:21:54.625 --> 02:21:55.750
-Is it him?
-No, sir.

02:21:55.958 --> 02:21:57.875
-Surya, look properly!
-No, sir!

02:21:58.458 --> 02:21:59.583
-Tell me!
-Hey!

02:22:00.791 --> 02:22:04.791
Men aged between
20-35 come forward.

02:22:10.958 --> 02:22:11.958
Come on, Surya.

02:22:12.541 --> 02:22:14.875
How can you not identify him now?

02:22:15.875 --> 02:22:17.166
He's supposed to be here, right?

02:22:19.875 --> 02:22:22.541
They're painting his
portrait and celebrating.

02:22:23.125 --> 02:22:24.291
I'm definite he's not among them, sir.

02:22:27.208 --> 02:22:28.416
-Sudha!
-Sir.

02:22:28.750 --> 02:22:31.125
-Check who's missing from the list.
-Sir.

02:22:31.250 --> 02:22:34.166
Sir, so many of us went
out of town for work.

02:22:35.500 --> 02:22:36.375
Went out of town…

02:22:36.458 --> 02:22:37.375
Who all?

02:22:38.083 --> 02:22:41.666
-So many of them.
-I want them all to come back right now!

02:22:41.750 --> 02:22:43.166
How can they suddenly…

02:22:43.291 --> 02:22:45.041
-Give us four to five days.
-Hey!

02:22:48.416 --> 02:22:49.541
Two days.

02:22:50.500 --> 02:22:52.166
Two days. Yeah.

02:22:53.041 --> 02:22:54.291
They should be here in two days.

02:22:55.666 --> 02:22:57.083
Just two days.

02:22:58.625 --> 02:23:01.125
I was worried about your safety
in case I told you I did all this.

02:23:01.375 --> 02:23:03.166
But not telling you
meant risking your lives.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:07.083
I don't get it, Dad.

02:23:10.041 --> 02:23:11.541
Forget about us.

02:23:13.458 --> 02:23:14.958
If you tell them that it's you…

02:23:16.625 --> 02:23:19.750
what's the point of
everything you've done so far?

02:23:23.833 --> 02:23:27.333
Even when your uncle abused
your aunt, she'd be meek.

02:23:29.916 --> 02:23:30.958
She feared him.

02:23:31.833 --> 02:23:34.083
The kind of fear the
people of Sokulapalem have.

02:23:35.500 --> 02:23:39.583
Your mom had the kind of anger you do now.

02:23:41.541 --> 02:23:42.625
What did she do?

02:23:43.208 --> 02:23:46.333
She assured your aunt that
she could survive on her own.

02:23:47.583 --> 02:23:49.583
She only gave her courage.

02:23:51.583 --> 02:23:52.916
Knowingly or unknowingly…

02:23:54.708 --> 02:23:57.208
you're walking in your mom's footsteps.

02:23:59.375 --> 02:24:01.166
How can you stop halfway now?

02:24:02.083 --> 02:24:04.041
Finish this the way you're meant to.

02:24:12.833 --> 02:24:13.875
Listen.

02:24:14.541 --> 02:24:16.333
I just had an epiphany.

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.875
Maybe these were the last
words your mom wanted to tell you.

02:24:22.208 --> 02:24:23.708
True anger isn't that which…

02:24:24.750 --> 02:24:27.083
makes a few people fear you.

02:24:29.041 --> 02:24:30.916
It is that which
empowers a group of people.

02:25:10.750 --> 02:25:11.791
Even he doesn't know.

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:15.250
He's torturing Surya because he
was there when Daya was beaten.

02:25:15.791 --> 02:25:18.625
Daya will not spare
you till he finds the guy.

02:25:21.541 --> 02:25:23.166
If we want to save ourselves,

02:25:23.541 --> 02:25:25.416
we should find out
who the Saturday guy is.

02:25:26.791 --> 02:25:28.333
Think about how to achieve that.

02:25:28.833 --> 02:25:31.500
Which quality do you
guys have in common?

02:25:31.625 --> 02:25:32.500
Fear?

02:25:36.083 --> 02:25:37.000
Fear.

02:25:37.375 --> 02:25:40.333
Daya is looking for the
scaredy-cat among you.

02:25:40.666 --> 02:25:42.625
The Saturday guy would be
scared because he hit Daya.

02:25:43.083 --> 02:25:44.083
But why are you guys scared?

02:25:44.166 --> 02:25:46.000
So, you being courageous isn't enough.

02:25:46.916 --> 02:25:50.500
Each one of you should be more
courageous than the person beside you.

02:25:50.916 --> 02:25:51.916
That's it!

02:25:52.416 --> 02:25:53.541
Show the same courage.

02:25:54.333 --> 02:25:55.458
The Saturday guy will be found.

02:25:56.125 --> 02:25:58.125
-They'll kill him once they find him.
-Let them!

02:25:58.666 --> 02:25:59.625
What's your problem?

02:26:00.541 --> 02:26:01.833
Why do we care if he dies?

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:06.041
We'll get him caught, go
inside, and weep like always.

02:26:06.541 --> 02:26:09.000
-Simple, right?
-That was before.

02:26:09.833 --> 02:26:11.833
Now we have mustered some courage.

02:26:12.375 --> 02:26:15.666
It's better to use that courage to
protect him rather than get him caught.

02:26:15.916 --> 02:26:18.750
When the Saturday guy wrote
on the wall for the first time,

02:26:19.416 --> 02:26:21.541
we got hope that it was one
of us who was fighting for us.

02:26:22.791 --> 02:26:24.958
When we got beaten because of him,

02:26:25.208 --> 02:26:26.750
we got angry with him.

02:26:28.541 --> 02:26:30.416
Now, in an attempt to get him caught,

02:26:31.375 --> 02:26:32.666
we got courage as well.

02:26:33.666 --> 02:26:36.166
He brought so many
changes in us unknowingly.

02:26:36.541 --> 02:26:39.291
-Such a guy…
-What do you plan on doing then?

02:26:40.333 --> 02:26:42.375
He took a step forward for all of us.

02:26:42.833 --> 02:26:45.083
Now we'll take a step forward for him.

02:26:48.291 --> 02:26:50.500
He has a big plan if he has
chosen to unite so many people.

02:26:51.291 --> 02:26:52.500
Plan? What plan?

02:26:53.708 --> 02:26:54.875
Mobile data plan.

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:56.041
What is it, Brother?

02:26:56.833 --> 02:26:58.000
Nothing.

02:26:58.666 --> 02:27:01.458
Something struck me
this morning while praying.

02:27:01.833 --> 02:27:05.125
How do you know that the Saturday
guy tried to kill me at the pub?

02:27:05.875 --> 02:27:08.000
How did you arrive at the right time?

02:27:09.375 --> 02:27:13.500
I've been guarding your
life every second, brother.

02:27:32.750 --> 02:27:34.291
And then this guy shows
up and gives me hell.

02:27:34.416 --> 02:27:35.333
Sir!

02:27:37.791 --> 02:27:39.041
-Sudha!
-Sir.

02:27:40.541 --> 02:27:42.208
How come we didn't doubt this?

02:27:44.250 --> 02:27:48.750
How did the Saturday guy
know that we were at the pub?

02:27:49.708 --> 02:27:50.708
Yes, sir.

02:27:51.041 --> 02:27:53.583
In fact, we didn't plan on
going until the last minute.

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:56.041
Exactly!

02:27:56.875 --> 02:27:58.375
Who else knows about the plan?

02:27:59.750 --> 02:28:00.750
The lawyer?

02:28:02.208 --> 02:28:03.583
He's not capable of that.

02:28:06.958 --> 02:28:08.500
Sir, me? No way!

02:28:09.375 --> 02:28:11.250
-Sorry.
-Sir, perfume?

02:28:16.958 --> 02:28:18.541
-Sir.
-You took his number, right?

02:28:18.625 --> 02:28:19.916
Call the NLIC guy.

02:28:23.791 --> 02:28:25.000
Charulatha!

02:28:25.958 --> 02:28:26.916
It's her!

02:28:31.041 --> 02:28:33.166
She's helping the Saturday guy.

02:28:34.166 --> 02:28:35.416
What the…

02:28:36.166 --> 02:28:38.791
But, who do you think he is?

02:28:39.708 --> 02:28:41.625
We need to figure out who he is.

02:28:45.833 --> 02:28:46.791
Bottle Cap.

02:28:48.833 --> 02:28:49.708
Bottle Cap!

02:28:51.333 --> 02:28:52.375
Surya!

02:28:54.958 --> 02:28:56.583
He's the Saturday guy.

02:28:57.958 --> 02:28:59.041
Bloody hell!

02:28:59.750 --> 02:29:02.083
He was right beside me the whole time.

02:29:04.041 --> 02:29:06.500
My brother's judgment was right, Sudha!

02:29:07.333 --> 02:29:08.250
Brother!

02:29:09.166 --> 02:29:10.208
We found him!

02:29:10.291 --> 02:29:11.833
Your judgment is right!

02:29:11.916 --> 02:29:12.958
It is him!

02:29:14.458 --> 02:29:15.458
You're right.

02:29:16.833 --> 02:29:17.833
We found him.

02:29:19.791 --> 02:29:21.291
But my judgment is wrong.

02:30:00.208 --> 02:30:01.708
-Sir!
-Brother…

02:30:01.958 --> 02:30:03.791
The Saturday guy got away.

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:05.041
I saw his face.

02:30:05.416 --> 02:30:06.416
It's Surya!

02:30:07.208 --> 02:30:08.666
-Surya?!
-Yes, sir.

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:19.041
When will Dad be here?

02:30:19.166 --> 02:30:20.625
He'll be here before you go into labor.

02:30:25.166 --> 02:30:26.125
Hello, sir.

02:30:26.708 --> 02:30:27.750
Hello, brother.

02:30:28.375 --> 02:30:30.250
I made you a promise, remember?

02:30:31.208 --> 02:30:34.500
I'll destroy his family in front
of his eyes when I find him.

02:30:35.208 --> 02:30:36.291
I know you remember.

02:30:37.541 --> 02:30:40.041
No more hide and seek.
I found him.

02:30:40.500 --> 02:30:43.083
And I started my
streak with his girlfriend.

02:30:45.416 --> 02:30:46.416
Say something.

02:30:46.666 --> 02:30:47.625
Charu?

02:30:50.541 --> 02:30:53.208
Hey, Bottle Cap!
Do you understand?

02:30:53.916 --> 02:30:55.458
Come fast. I'm waiting.

02:30:57.916 --> 02:30:58.791
Surya!

02:31:05.041 --> 02:31:06.083
SATURDAY

02:31:27.541 --> 02:31:28.583
Aunty, Charu…

02:31:29.958 --> 02:31:31.375
Surya…

02:31:36.291 --> 02:31:37.375
Aunty…

02:31:40.708 --> 02:31:41.708
It's me, Chinnu.

02:31:42.875 --> 02:31:43.833
Chinnu?

02:31:45.750 --> 02:31:46.666
Chinnu…

02:31:49.041 --> 02:31:51.875
-Aunty…
-I didn't think I'd see you again.

02:31:51.958 --> 02:31:53.125
So Charu is…

02:31:54.583 --> 02:31:55.500
Kallu?

02:31:55.625 --> 02:31:56.625
Kallu!

02:32:04.833 --> 02:32:06.833
My patience has worn out.

02:32:06.958 --> 02:32:09.041
My tears have dried out.

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:11.041
Understood?

02:32:11.583 --> 02:32:12.500
Come.

02:32:31.083 --> 02:32:32.750
SOKULAPALEM

02:32:40.875 --> 02:32:42.041
Come, come!

02:33:14.708 --> 02:33:15.583
Sudha…

02:33:15.666 --> 02:33:18.541
I took him for an innocent
guy due to his performance.

02:33:18.791 --> 02:33:20.833
But I turned out to be the
innocent one in this story.

02:33:21.250 --> 02:33:22.791
He played me.

02:33:23.791 --> 02:33:26.583
Hey! Show me your performance now.

02:33:26.791 --> 02:33:29.250
Let's see how natural it is.

02:34:13.125 --> 02:34:15.291
You've played a big game.

02:34:18.541 --> 02:34:21.375
REDEMPTION

02:34:21.500 --> 02:34:23.166
Seems like she lost a lot of blood.

02:34:24.833 --> 02:34:27.291
She needs to go to the hospital.

02:34:27.708 --> 02:34:28.875
Will you take her?

02:34:30.333 --> 02:34:32.708
But I have a condition.

02:34:35.166 --> 02:34:36.125
See these people?

02:34:37.875 --> 02:34:40.625
If at least one of them…

02:34:41.458 --> 02:34:44.750
opens the door and displays
the courage you gave them…

02:34:45.708 --> 02:34:47.250
I'll personally take her to the hospital.

02:34:48.375 --> 02:34:49.375
Okay?

02:34:50.500 --> 02:34:52.375
Get up!

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:54.916
Call them!

02:34:58.166 --> 02:34:59.083
Rajanna…

02:35:00.333 --> 02:35:02.000
If you don't step out now, you never will.

02:35:03.791 --> 02:35:04.750
Laxman!

02:35:15.750 --> 02:35:17.625
The courage you wanted
to see isn't here with us.

02:35:17.708 --> 02:35:19.708
Let me show you what fear does!

02:35:23.541 --> 02:35:24.416
Hey!

02:35:24.541 --> 02:35:26.041
Come on out, everyone!

02:35:45.458 --> 02:35:46.833
Why are you standing?

02:35:47.125 --> 02:35:48.583
He'll mistake it for courage.

02:35:49.041 --> 02:35:51.916
Kneel down! Come on!

02:36:02.166 --> 02:36:05.875
I was hoping he'd show
me who the Saturday guy is.

02:36:08.583 --> 02:36:12.458
But instead, I'm telling you
that he's the Saturday guy.

02:36:17.666 --> 02:36:19.958
What's even funnier is,

02:36:20.208 --> 02:36:23.416
he was going to bring out
your courage by hitting me.

02:36:24.125 --> 02:36:25.125
Am I right?

02:36:26.666 --> 02:36:27.708
Come!

02:36:34.458 --> 02:36:36.041
You'll give them courage?

02:36:37.416 --> 02:36:38.458
Answer me!

02:36:53.083 --> 02:36:55.083
-How much?
-Two hundred rupees.

02:36:55.250 --> 02:36:57.291
Two hundred? It's nearby.

02:36:57.500 --> 02:36:58.708
I brought you into the lane, sir.

02:36:59.375 --> 02:37:01.666
Sir, do you have change for 500 rupees?

02:37:04.458 --> 02:37:05.583
I guess he doesn't.

02:37:05.958 --> 02:37:08.500
Alright. Keep this.

02:37:23.958 --> 02:37:25.125
It's Kallu, Dad.

02:37:32.083 --> 02:37:33.083
What?

02:37:48.416 --> 02:37:49.583
Sit down, sir.

02:37:50.416 --> 02:37:51.333
Sit down, sir.

02:37:51.458 --> 02:37:53.041
You might not be able to sit again.

02:37:57.333 --> 02:37:58.208
Sudha…

02:37:58.916 --> 02:38:02.041
He's losing his shit
watching his son like this.

02:38:02.875 --> 02:38:03.750
No, sir.

02:38:04.583 --> 02:38:06.291
He and I, we're used to this.

02:38:08.041 --> 02:38:09.000
Come.

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:12.750
You just met him.

02:38:14.041 --> 02:38:15.875
You need to know who he is as a person.

02:38:16.583 --> 02:38:20.916
He's not the type to project
his anger on someone else.

02:38:21.250 --> 02:38:23.125
From the moment he feels anger,

02:38:23.500 --> 02:38:26.625
he writes down the person's
name, introspects his anger,

02:38:26.708 --> 02:38:28.708
and if he still feels that
his anger is justified,

02:38:29.708 --> 02:38:31.875
he schedules that person's
wrath for that Saturday.

02:38:32.708 --> 02:38:34.125
No matter who it is.

02:38:35.416 --> 02:38:37.541
In fact, he was angry at you as well.

02:38:39.500 --> 02:38:42.541
The first time, when he was
going to write your name down,

02:38:42.625 --> 02:38:43.541
Charu…

02:38:45.958 --> 02:38:47.375
He stopped because of her thought.

02:38:48.125 --> 02:38:49.083
You got saved.

02:38:53.458 --> 02:38:55.458
He wrote your name down the second time.

02:38:56.958 --> 02:38:57.833
But, I…

02:38:58.000 --> 02:38:59.833
I gave him sleeping pills and stopped him.

02:39:00.250 --> 02:39:01.416
I kind of saved you.

02:39:03.125 --> 02:39:06.416
Killing all chances of ever
writing your name down again…

02:39:07.041 --> 02:39:10.916
my daughter made him promise
to quit these Saturday fights.

02:39:11.166 --> 02:39:12.458
She completely saved you.

02:39:14.375 --> 02:39:16.708
You owe your life to our family, sir.

02:39:17.166 --> 02:39:19.750
For saving you from this beast.

02:39:26.291 --> 02:39:31.416
So, I'm alive today because
of the promise he made to his sister?

02:39:32.791 --> 02:39:37.750
Sudha, it's funny how I got out alive
so many times without my involvement.

02:39:38.625 --> 02:39:41.291
Something else also happened
without your involvement.

02:39:44.250 --> 02:39:45.375
Surya.

02:39:47.333 --> 02:39:49.458
Remember what Mom used to say?

02:39:52.083 --> 02:39:55.625
"The day your anger is truly
justified, I won't say a word."

02:39:57.833 --> 02:39:59.583
Dad told me everything.

02:40:02.625 --> 02:40:03.916
Today is your day.

02:40:05.458 --> 02:40:06.750
I won't say a word.

02:40:11.833 --> 02:40:14.250
She gave you permission.
What are you waiting for?

02:40:14.625 --> 02:40:16.583
That's what I don't understand, sir.

02:40:17.458 --> 02:40:20.125
When he decides to
hit a guy every Saturday…

02:40:20.916 --> 02:40:23.458
I go to them and warn them beforehand.

02:40:25.083 --> 02:40:28.458
Similarly, I came to warn you.

02:40:28.916 --> 02:40:31.166
But here, he's on the floor.

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.208
I called him a beast before.

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:36.916
No, sir.

02:40:37.958 --> 02:40:39.375
He's a changed man.

02:40:41.458 --> 02:40:45.958
There's no place he hasn't
looked for his aunt and Kallu.

02:40:46.875 --> 02:40:48.875
Kallu is the love of his life.

02:40:49.375 --> 02:40:51.541
They're the lives his mother
has preciously guarded.

02:40:52.291 --> 02:40:56.333
Despite that, when you touched
Kallu, my daughter-in-law,

02:40:56.458 --> 02:40:58.333
he calmed his anger down,

02:40:58.416 --> 02:41:03.166
waiting for their lives to change,
for them to muster courage.

02:41:03.500 --> 02:41:04.708
He's a changed man, sir.

02:41:07.500 --> 02:41:09.333
You're one lucky man, sir.

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:10.958
Look.

02:41:11.375 --> 02:41:15.000
The people of Sokulapalem
are protecting you now.

02:41:18.291 --> 02:41:19.625
By chance of luck,

02:41:19.958 --> 02:41:25.000
even if one of them musters the
courage and takes a step forward…

02:41:28.625 --> 02:41:31.250
you've only seen his two
eyes at the pub that day.

02:41:32.875 --> 02:41:34.750
You'll see his third eye now.

02:41:36.291 --> 02:41:37.750
It's going to be Shiva Tandavam.

02:41:46.666 --> 02:41:51.041
So, if I want to see the
Saturday guy you're talking about…

02:41:52.041 --> 02:41:55.708
one of them has to
courageously step forward?

02:41:55.791 --> 02:41:56.666
Yes, sir.

02:42:00.208 --> 02:42:02.666
These fools aren't coming
forward no matter what I do.

02:42:04.541 --> 02:42:05.541
What should I do?

02:42:05.625 --> 02:42:06.791
What should I do?

02:42:14.666 --> 02:42:17.375
Sir, please let her go.

02:42:17.458 --> 02:42:20.041
She's a little girl.
Please let her go.

02:42:20.125 --> 02:42:22.291
Sir, let her go! Please!

02:42:26.250 --> 02:42:28.500
Sir, please let her go.

02:42:29.083 --> 02:42:31.541
If I kill this little girl…

02:42:31.916 --> 02:42:33.083
would that be enough?

02:42:52.708 --> 02:42:54.000
Keep them coming!

02:42:54.083 --> 02:42:55.333
This is not enough!

02:42:55.416 --> 02:42:56.458
This is not enough!

02:43:31.083 --> 02:43:32.791
That's enough!

02:44:09.083 --> 02:44:12.250
He, the one who breaks
The shackles of doubt

02:44:12.458 --> 02:44:14.791
With a fierce and intense gaze

02:44:14.916 --> 02:44:17.333
His nails are like blazing
Flames on a mountain

02:44:17.666 --> 02:44:20.583
He is the constant force
Of balance on a Saturday

02:44:32.125 --> 02:44:34.833
The battlefield is ready for war

02:44:34.916 --> 02:44:37.500
Let the conch shells echo in the air

02:44:37.583 --> 02:44:40.125
Even your eyes launch weapons

02:44:40.208 --> 02:44:42.916
Your blood boils with the fuel of breath

02:44:54.416 --> 02:44:57.208
The warrior of ferocity burns wild

02:44:57.291 --> 02:44:59.666
The war bells ring with an echo

02:44:59.791 --> 02:45:02.333
There is fire flaring up all around

02:45:02.416 --> 02:45:05.041
It is going to be Shiva Tandavam

02:45:10.458 --> 02:45:13.208
The warrior of ferocity burns wild

02:45:13.291 --> 02:45:15.875
The war bells ring with an echo

02:45:15.958 --> 02:45:18.416
There is fire flaring up all around

02:45:18.500 --> 02:45:21.458
It is going to be Shiva Tandavam

02:45:39.625 --> 02:45:40.708
You guys go, ma'am!

02:46:59.875 --> 02:47:03.625
You can't leave without telling
me how the performance was!

02:47:09.458 --> 02:47:10.625
Oh, no!

02:47:14.583 --> 02:47:16.083
You need to go to the hospital.

02:47:17.416 --> 02:47:18.375
Will you go?

02:47:19.541 --> 02:47:20.833
But I have one condition.

02:47:21.875 --> 02:47:25.166
If at least one of them…

02:47:26.125 --> 02:47:28.291
comes forward and says…

02:47:28.375 --> 02:47:30.708
"Poor guy, Surya! Let him go."

02:47:31.666 --> 02:47:33.875
I'll personally take you to the hospital.

02:47:35.833 --> 02:47:36.750
Okay?

02:47:38.416 --> 02:47:40.416
Go ahead. Ask!

02:47:53.541 --> 02:47:56.583
There lived a demon called
Narakasur in the olden days.

02:47:57.250 --> 02:47:58.791
He used to trouble people a lot.

02:47:59.208 --> 02:48:02.416
So Sri Krishna teamed up with Satyabhama…

02:48:03.083 --> 02:48:04.333
and killed him.

02:48:06.166 --> 02:48:07.541
Those were the olden days.

02:48:08.958 --> 02:48:09.875
Back then.

02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:12.125
These are modern times.

02:48:13.583 --> 02:48:16.625
We can't keep waiting for
new avatars and heroes.

02:48:17.583 --> 02:48:18.708
We should stand up for ourselves.

02:48:20.333 --> 02:48:21.458
Mankind should help each other.

02:48:23.416 --> 02:48:25.208
We have to be there for one another.

02:48:27.291 --> 02:48:28.791
No matter who the opposite person is.

02:49:03.250 --> 02:49:06.125
There's action in my life.

02:49:06.916 --> 02:49:09.291
There's emotion and suspense.

02:49:10.041 --> 02:49:11.208
There's everything, in fact.

02:49:12.333 --> 02:49:14.916
Except for romance.

02:49:18.708 --> 02:49:20.083
You've known me for a while.

02:49:21.208 --> 02:49:23.041
Didn't you ever have feelings for me?

02:49:28.916 --> 02:49:31.166
For your "Bottle Cap" face?

02:49:33.041 --> 02:49:35.125
-Surya…
-Yes, Dad!

02:49:37.708 --> 02:49:40.208
Your "Scooty Pep" face got
lucky with this "Bottle Cap."

02:49:43.166 --> 02:49:44.041
Nani.

02:49:47.458 --> 02:49:48.500
Did you call me, Samantha?

02:49:51.291 --> 02:49:54.125
I'm feeling like you're calling me,
even though you aren't.

02:49:55.250 --> 02:49:57.125
I can imagine how special I am to you.

02:50:07.958 --> 02:50:09.958
You said your mom was going to
be reborn as your sister's daughter.

02:50:10.333 --> 02:50:11.500
We're forever in agreement now.

02:50:11.916 --> 02:50:13.166
We'll abide by whatever your mom says.

02:50:51.708 --> 02:50:53.000
I got angry.

02:50:54.208 --> 02:50:55.916
And once I get angry,

02:50:56.541 --> 02:50:57.500
they become my family.

02:50:57.916 --> 02:50:59.000
And this becomes my problem.

02:51:39.458 --> 02:51:40.500
I won't spare them.

02:51:41.166 --> 02:51:42.333
I won't spare any of them.
