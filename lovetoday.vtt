04:56.916 --> 05:01.166
WITH CRAZY LOVE,
UTHAMAN PRADEEP

05:55.541 --> 05:57.166
I know you that well, baby.

06:10.125 --> 06:11.208
What happened, Nikitha?

06:12.666 --> 06:15.166
Well, Pradeep, what would I tell my dad?

06:16.333 --> 06:18.000
Just lie to your dad.

06:19.166 --> 06:20.125
Lie to my dad?!

07:01.958 --> 07:03.958
I didn't tell you
because it was a surprise, Dad.

07:05.083 --> 07:06.166
I'm surprised.

07:06.916 --> 07:07.750
So, did you go alone?

07:08.041 --> 07:09.958
-No, with Shweta.
-Yes, Dad.

07:12.250 --> 07:15.708
You sisters always make me buy stuff
online saying there are discounts.

07:16.875 --> 07:18.291
And now, you guys went shopping?!

07:18.375 --> 07:19.625
-There was an offer in Poorvika, Dad.
-There was an offer in Poorvika, Dad.

07:19.708 --> 07:21.583
Flipkart has the Big Billion Day sale.

07:21.791 --> 07:23.083
-We wanted to--
-We wanted to--

07:25.625 --> 07:27.250
We wanted to check it out in person.

07:28.666 --> 07:29.625
Did you check it out?

07:29.875 --> 07:30.708
Dad?

07:31.291 --> 07:32.250
Just joking.

07:34.541 --> 07:36.291
-Dual sim?
-Single sim, Dad.

07:36.958 --> 07:38.916
-How much?
-Thirty-five thousand.

07:39.333 --> 07:40.166
How come?

07:40.708 --> 07:41.750
I had saved up some money.

07:43.125 --> 07:44.791
Thirty-five thousand!

07:47.416 --> 07:49.916
Your money, your rules.

07:50.000 --> 07:50.875
No, Dad, this--

07:54.166 --> 07:55.250
-Okay, Dad.
-Okay, Dad.

08:36.500 --> 08:37.625
Does it not look good on me?

08:38.125 --> 08:40.750
I was wondering if you'd
let go of that strong grip.

08:41.250 --> 08:43.458
-Hey.
-For fun!

08:46.666 --> 08:49.291
Of course,
I'll let go of that strong grip, but…

08:50.375 --> 08:53.500
you'll never be free of this strong grip.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.083
Damn, that was awesome!

09:24.125 --> 09:26.208
A bracelet and an ear stud!

09:26.458 --> 09:28.083
I hope your mom doesn't get suspicious.

09:28.666 --> 09:29.666
She won't!

09:31.166 --> 09:34.166
-Mom!
-Tell me, who gifted it?

09:34.250 --> 09:36.541
-It's style, Mom!
-I asked, who gifted it?

09:36.625 --> 09:38.833
It's in fashion, Mom! It's style!

09:38.916 --> 09:41.041
Style?! You look like a thug!

09:42.833 --> 09:43.916
Style, my foot!

09:49.041 --> 09:51.916
You've changed ever since
you bought that phone.

09:53.541 --> 09:56.500
Oh God, I'm exhausted!

09:57.458 --> 09:59.833
That's what will happen if you're
on the phone around the clock.

10:01.041 --> 10:03.083
-So, what does your son do?
-Play.

10:03.166 --> 10:04.291
-Play?
-On the phone!

10:07.083 --> 10:09.416
You'll go into depression
if you don't get proper sleep.

10:09.958 --> 10:11.041
You'll get dark circles.

10:11.625 --> 10:13.875
You look tanned.
I guess it's because of the phone light.

10:14.125 --> 10:17.625
God! Phone radiations have
chased away all the crows!

10:20.250 --> 10:21.833
Why do you need the phone while sleeping?

10:22.500 --> 10:24.166
Why do you need the phone while eating?

10:24.250 --> 10:25.916
Why do you need the phone in the toilet?

10:26.208 --> 10:28.750
-Oh, no! Dhoni's out!
-Oh, no! Dhoni's out!

10:29.125 --> 10:30.958
He must've been on the phone
the whole night, that's why he's out!

10:33.041 --> 10:34.958
The radiation heat
will make you impotent.

10:35.416 --> 10:36.541
Your heart will go for a toss!

10:37.333 --> 10:40.291
Can you hear the traffic
if you wear earphones?

10:40.375 --> 10:43.416
-I can. Just get on the bike.
-My foot!

10:45.541 --> 10:47.541
-Did you hear what I said?
-I did.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.583
How? I didn't even utter a word!

10:52.000 --> 10:53.208
Waiter, this dish sucks!

10:53.333 --> 10:54.208
What?

10:54.666 --> 10:56.833
That's what will happen
if you're on the phone while eating.

11:12.125 --> 11:13.000
I'm charging it now.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.250
Take good care of the puppy I gifted you.

11:32.125 --> 11:35.166
Phone calls are more important to you
than the mother's milk I fed you?!

11:35.250 --> 11:38.583
That was one confusing
and senseless statement, Mom!

11:39.208 --> 11:41.708
Right! I'm senseless!

11:41.958 --> 11:44.166
In two days,
your elder sister is getting engaged,

11:44.250 --> 11:46.625
and you're talking on the phone
while charging it!

11:46.708 --> 11:48.333
Don't you read the news?

11:48.500 --> 11:50.458
A guy died when his phone
blasted while it was charging.

11:50.541 --> 11:53.125
Do you think your sister's wedding
will take place without you?

11:55.458 --> 11:57.750
My mom is so sure that I'll die.

11:59.791 --> 12:00.625
Fine.

12:00.708 --> 12:03.583
Didn't you want to find out if Divya
is interested in this marriage?

12:03.791 --> 12:04.750
Did you ask her?

12:19.541 --> 12:20.375
Why?

12:21.000 --> 12:21.833
Why not?

12:22.500 --> 12:23.333
Well…

12:23.875 --> 12:25.916
-are you doing this for others--
-Wait!

12:26.000 --> 12:27.125
Have this sweet.

12:28.041 --> 12:29.125
-Thanks.
-Welcome.

12:32.291 --> 12:34.708
An arranged marriage, that too,
without knowing the person--

12:34.791 --> 12:36.500
I do know the guy.

12:36.791 --> 12:40.333
His name is Yogi. He's a doctor,
the chief dentist. What else do I--

12:41.208 --> 12:42.166
Doctor!

12:42.750 --> 12:44.833
Don't be senseless like Mom.

12:44.916 --> 12:46.583
He is a doctor by <i>profession.</i>

12:46.666 --> 12:48.250
I'm talking about his character here.

12:48.625 --> 12:52.416
What if Dr. Yogi is a drunkard?

12:55.333 --> 12:56.166
What if he's a psycho?

12:58.708 --> 12:59.666
What if he's an abuser?

13:01.333 --> 13:02.750
<i>-What if he's a weirdo?</i>
-Please!

13:03.000 --> 13:03.958
Help me, please!

13:04.041 --> 13:05.041
<i>What if he's a sociopath?</i>

13:06.791 --> 13:08.125
<i>What if he's stupid?</i>

13:08.208 --> 13:09.166
Yes.

13:10.541 --> 13:11.541
<i>What if he has toxic traits?</i>

13:11.875 --> 13:12.916
I'm not the father of this child!

13:13.833 --> 13:14.666
<i>What if he's a pervert?</i>

13:14.750 --> 13:16.541
-I've been waiting to do this for so long!
-Let go of me!

13:16.625 --> 13:19.541
-Granny, come on! Show me!
-Stop it, please!

13:19.625 --> 13:20.750
-What if he's egoistic?
-Hey!

13:21.250 --> 13:22.166
Enough, Pradeep!

13:22.791 --> 13:26.458
How can you marry a stranger, Divya?

13:27.000 --> 13:28.291
You're going to spend
your whole life with him.

13:29.750 --> 13:31.750
Shouldn't you know the reason
behind your partner's smile?

13:32.541 --> 13:33.500
Shouldn't you know the reason…

13:34.625 --> 13:35.875
behind your partner's anger?

13:36.416 --> 13:37.333
There--

13:49.833 --> 13:51.708
There must be chemistry.

13:52.333 --> 13:53.416
You must get to know
the person in and out.

13:54.208 --> 13:55.041
Okay.

13:55.125 --> 13:57.916
How long do you think
it'll take to know a person?

14:01.291 --> 14:02.125
Maybe a year.

14:02.416 --> 14:04.875
There's an eight-month gap between
our engagement and the wedding.

14:04.958 --> 14:06.500
Won't that suffice?

14:07.083 --> 14:09.500
What if she doesn't like
him after eight months?

14:09.791 --> 14:11.166
<i>Wait, I'm not done yet.</i>

14:11.666 --> 14:12.916
Let me explain.

14:14.166 --> 14:17.125
Imagine you go to a restaurant
and order a new dish.

14:18.833 --> 14:21.500
What would you do if you
didn't like it after tasting it?

14:22.791 --> 14:26.458
I'll dump it just like how I dumped
that sweet that's gone bad, on you!

14:29.875 --> 14:31.291
She doesn't understand.

14:31.541 --> 14:34.000
Leave it. Not everyone is lucky like us.

14:36.708 --> 14:37.833
You're right, baby.

14:38.916 --> 14:41.125
My family is pressurizing me
to choose a groom.

14:41.583 --> 14:43.875
Every guy my dad shows
me is a boomer groom.

14:45.791 --> 14:47.250
Tell him you don't like any of them.

14:47.500 --> 14:50.333
He wants me to write down ten reasons
daily as to why I don't like each of them.

14:50.708 --> 14:53.500
I'm desperately trying to come up
with the tenth reason, Pradeep.

14:53.625 --> 14:55.166
It's not like we are too old now.

14:56.291 --> 14:59.208
Yeah, you're just 24, after all…

14:59.291 --> 15:01.666
and I am already 24!

15:02.125 --> 15:05.000
Fine, let my sister get married.

15:05.666 --> 15:07.166
Give me some time,
I'll come and talk to your dad.

15:08.083 --> 15:10.791
On top of all this,
remember Kaushik from my office?

15:10.875 --> 15:11.833
Yes.

15:12.125 --> 15:13.541
Oh my God!

15:13.750 --> 15:15.750
He asked me out for a movie!

15:15.916 --> 15:17.333
<i>Can you believe it?</i>

15:18.250 --> 15:20.458
I refused though.
Wait, I'll send you the screenshot.

15:20.541 --> 15:22.833
Screenshot? Are you nuts?

15:22.916 --> 15:26.125
I know you very well. You don't
have to send me a screenshot, idiot.

15:29.500 --> 15:30.625
Fine…

15:32.625 --> 15:33.625
send me a pic.

15:34.750 --> 15:35.583
Hey!

15:35.666 --> 15:38.666
Please send me one. I promise I'll
delete it immediately after I see it.

15:40.500 --> 15:43.333
Will you? Please!

15:43.416 --> 15:46.416
<i>I'm asking just for myself! Please!</i>

15:47.000 --> 15:47.916
Fine.

15:48.791 --> 15:49.791
So, are you sending it?

15:55.041 --> 15:57.208
Not convincing enough.
Send me a better one.

16:32.250 --> 16:33.750
Please pack it.

17:41.458 --> 17:45.583
<i>You and your sister look awesome!</i>
<i>Shall I come over for the night?</i>

17:46.333 --> 17:47.291
Hey…

17:47.458 --> 17:49.375
are you getting any messages
from this account?

17:51.416 --> 17:53.750
I'm getting vulgar comments on my post.

17:58.375 --> 18:00.541
<i>You'll spend your first night</i>
<i>with Lucky after the wedding…</i>

18:00.791 --> 18:05.500
<i>but I know it won't be your first time.</i>
<i>What's the count?</i>

18:11.125 --> 18:12.083
On Instagram?

18:12.708 --> 18:13.666
Yes.

18:14.833 --> 18:15.791
Just block him.

18:16.958 --> 18:19.041
Then he'll create a new account
and trouble me.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.583
Then make your both accounts private.

18:22.166 --> 18:23.458
What else can we do?

18:23.833 --> 18:25.458
It'd be petty to file a cyber complaint.

18:25.916 --> 18:27.583
I don't even know how to file one.

18:28.625 --> 18:30.250
That pervert will keep having fun…

18:31.083 --> 18:32.708
and we should do nothing about it?!

18:33.166 --> 18:34.166
I'm pissed off!

18:34.625 --> 18:36.000
Calm down. Chill.

18:37.166 --> 18:39.166
Hope you'll be attending my
sister's engagement tomorrow.

18:40.250 --> 18:42.708
To be honest, I'm a bit scared.

18:43.166 --> 18:44.791
I hope your family doesn't get suspicious.

18:44.875 --> 18:47.625
I invited you
because I want them to get suspicious.

18:52.083 --> 18:54.500
Don't come tomorrow.
Please don't come tomorrow.

18:58.625 --> 19:00.041
-Give it to me.
-Here, priest.

19:00.125 --> 19:01.333
-Did you wash it properly?
-Yes.

19:17.375 --> 19:19.291
-Give me the phone!
-Hey!

19:20.791 --> 19:24.458
-Pradeep, how are you?
-I'm good.

19:24.666 --> 19:25.958
You're next.

19:26.041 --> 19:27.541
I'm hearing this for the 230th time today!

19:27.625 --> 19:29.916
Rani, how are you?

19:30.000 --> 19:32.291
-I'm good.
-You're playing on your phone here?!

19:32.375 --> 19:33.416
Get inside!

19:54.625 --> 19:55.916
-Hey!
-Hey!

19:56.000 --> 19:57.833
No! Stop it!

19:57.916 --> 20:00.958
-Hey, stop it!
-Hey!

20:01.333 --> 20:02.333
What the hell!

20:02.416 --> 20:03.250
Take him away!

20:09.625 --> 20:11.875
Uncle, here you go. Lime juice.

20:13.416 --> 20:14.708
The lime taste will be a bit strong.

20:17.541 --> 20:19.041
I think they added too much salt.

20:19.750 --> 20:20.916
Guess it's sherbet.

20:25.125 --> 20:26.166
What? What is it?

20:27.541 --> 20:29.083
Nothing! Just for fun!

20:37.875 --> 20:39.875
Hey, you! Give it back!

20:39.958 --> 20:42.458
-Pulthish, let go of it!
-Give it to me.

20:46.833 --> 20:48.291
<i>Where are you? I am here!</i>

20:48.375 --> 20:49.791
Wait, I'm coming. Sorry.

21:18.375 --> 21:20.416
-You look awesome.
-Thanks.

21:23.791 --> 21:25.458
Oh, yes, this is Revi.

21:26.166 --> 21:27.750
-Hi, Ravi.
-Not Ravi…

21:28.708 --> 21:30.500
-it's Revi.
-Revi?

21:31.458 --> 21:33.541
-Hi, Revi.
-Hi, bro.

21:33.625 --> 21:35.833
-Pradeep, please help us.
-Revi, come, let's help them.

21:35.916 --> 21:37.875
-Get down, you menace!
-No, I won't!

21:37.958 --> 21:39.083
-Thanks, Revi.
-No! Please!

21:40.041 --> 21:41.500
Listen to me! Get down!

21:41.583 --> 21:42.916
Revi, eyes on the work!

21:43.000 --> 21:44.750
-Please!
-It's mine. I won't give it to you.

21:44.833 --> 21:46.166
Please, Uncle. Give it to us.

21:46.250 --> 21:47.375
-Hi, sister.
-Meet Mani.

21:47.458 --> 21:48.916
Alias your buddy. Your best friend.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.958
You don't make any decision without
considering him. Your trustworthy friend.

21:53.958 --> 21:55.291
That's what you told her about me?!

22:01.083 --> 22:03.583
-And this is--
-Wait! Let me guess!

22:03.875 --> 22:06.208
Bhaskar. Works for Tesla.

22:06.291 --> 22:08.708
You bluff a lot, and yes, you never lie!

22:09.458 --> 22:11.583
-Dude, those are my boxers!
-Oh, no! I'm caught!

22:11.875 --> 22:13.083
-He is my--
-C++ Shiva.

22:13.166 --> 22:16.916
He can hack any system in a jiffy
but still wets the bed.

22:19.875 --> 22:20.708
Dude!

22:20.791 --> 22:21.916
I don't keep any secrets from her.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.208
Tell her <i>your</i> secrets! Why would
you tell her about my bed wetting?

22:25.500 --> 22:26.333
Mom's here.

22:27.041 --> 22:27.875
Mom, this is--

22:31.625 --> 22:34.375
-Bless me.
-God bless you.

22:34.625 --> 22:37.458
-How are you?
-I'm good, how are you?

22:37.541 --> 22:40.791
I'm good. So, I hear you're
the best mother in this world.

22:42.916 --> 22:44.458
He really said that?!

22:44.791 --> 22:47.375
You don't look like his mother,
you look like his sister.

22:47.458 --> 22:48.625
Oh, God!

22:52.208 --> 22:53.625
Really? You're on your phone <i>now?!</i>

22:53.708 --> 22:58.458
Yes, spot on, dear!
To hell with him and his phone!

23:00.708 --> 23:02.916
-Can I use the restroom?
-Sure!

23:03.166 --> 23:06.833
-Go straight, and--
-Take a right, and it'll be in the corner.

23:08.833 --> 23:09.708
Yes.

23:10.750 --> 23:11.708
Watch out! Your head--

23:11.791 --> 23:14.208
The back door of your house is a bit low.

23:15.000 --> 23:15.916
I know that.

23:16.166 --> 23:18.916
Oh!

23:21.375 --> 23:22.250
So, she's a friend?

23:23.458 --> 23:24.291
Yes.

23:32.458 --> 23:36.458
Why is your expression like Jerry's
when he gets squeezed by Tom?

23:50.083 --> 23:54.166
<i>Everyone had their eyes on her</i>
<i>But her eyes were on me</i>

23:54.250 --> 23:58.750
<i>Believe me when I say</i>
<i>She got my number first! Hell, yeah!</i>

23:59.291 --> 24:03.458
<i>If anybody shows off</i>
<i>She'll ask them to bug off</i>

24:03.541 --> 24:08.125
<i>All she wants is to talk to me</i>
<i>Really? Am I Mr. Smarty?</i>

24:08.625 --> 24:13.000
<i>She got me mesmerized</i>
<i>With that cute smile of hers</i>

24:13.083 --> 24:17.250
<i>She made me fall for her</i>
<i>With those eyes of hers</i>

24:17.791 --> 24:22.250
<i>I was focused and steady</i>
<i>What magic spell did you cast on me?</i>

24:22.333 --> 24:26.833
<i>I'm so restless now</i>
<i>Flying so high in your love</i>

24:33.708 --> 24:38.208
<i>She made me fall in love</i>
<i>Yes, I'm in love</i>

24:38.291 --> 24:42.291
<i>I am not the same anymore</i>
<i>Yes, she's the one I love</i>

24:43.041 --> 24:47.291
<i>She made me fall in love</i>
<i>Yes, I'm in love</i>

24:47.541 --> 24:51.375
<i>I am not the same anymore</i>
<i>Yes, she's the one I love</i>

24:54.083 --> 24:56.541
<i>She made me fall in love</i>

24:58.375 --> 25:00.750
<i>I am not the same anymore</i>

25:02.875 --> 25:05.583
<i>She made me fall in love</i>

25:07.500 --> 25:09.791
<i>I am not the same anymore</i>

25:16.916 --> 25:17.833
Where is she going?

25:28.625 --> 25:29.541
Mom, do you have a pin?

25:31.041 --> 25:32.041
Who is he?

25:32.458 --> 25:34.083
-He's like a brother to me.
-Oh.

25:34.916 --> 25:36.208
Can't you use a pin and cover up yourself?

25:36.458 --> 25:38.541
Sorry. I didn't do it on purpose.

25:39.416 --> 25:41.666
I'm not saying you did it on purpose.
Just remember it next time.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.416
I didn't pin it yet.

25:52.833 --> 25:54.083
For fun!

26:12.041 --> 26:15.791
<i>Life sucks during every tough phase</i>

26:15.875 --> 26:20.708
<i>With you by my side</i>
<i>Everything will fall in place</i>

26:21.000 --> 26:25.083
<i>Forget kissing but a kiss smiley</i>
<i>Is all I need from you</i>

26:25.166 --> 26:30.000
<i>And I'll be on cloud nine every day</i>
<i>Thinking about you</i>

26:30.333 --> 26:34.708
<i>I know at times we'll argue and fight</i>

26:34.791 --> 26:38.625
<i>One kiss from you</i>
<i>And everything will be fine</i>

26:38.875 --> 26:43.500
<i>I have spent enough time with you</i>
<i>And I know you in and out</i>

26:43.583 --> 26:47.791
<i>Even a slip from your end is also</i>
<i>Something I'll admire, no doubt</i>

26:47.875 --> 26:52.458
<i>I've got your back</i>
<i>I'm holding on to you tight</i>

26:52.625 --> 26:56.416
<i>I won't let go of you</i>
<i>You'll never be out of my sight</i>

26:57.166 --> 27:01.666
<i>I've got your back</i>
<i>I'm holding on to you tight</i>

27:01.958 --> 27:06.541
<i>Now, I won't let go of you</i>
<i>You'll never be out of my sight</i>

27:06.625 --> 27:10.916
<i>Everyone had their eyes on her</i>
<i>But her eyes were on me</i>

27:11.000 --> 27:15.458
<i>Believe me when I say</i>
<i>She got my number first! Hell, yeah!</i>

27:15.833 --> 27:17.666
Meet Dinesh.

27:18.583 --> 27:20.041
What's so funny?

27:20.708 --> 27:23.291
-I'll tell you later.
-Promise? Or else, I'll bash you up!

27:23.375 --> 27:24.208
Okay, I'll tell.

27:44.875 --> 27:47.458
<i>She made me fall in love</i>

27:49.416 --> 27:51.791
<i>I'm not the same anymore</i>

27:53.875 --> 27:56.416
<i>She made me fall in love</i>

27:58.583 --> 28:00.791
<i>I'm not the same anymore</i>

28:34.208 --> 28:35.791
-Hello.
-Hello?

28:35.875 --> 28:36.916
Can you hear me?

28:37.000 --> 28:38.041
Can you hear me, bae?

28:38.208 --> 28:39.875
Hello, can you hear me?

28:40.916 --> 28:41.750
Hello, baby?

28:42.500 --> 28:43.458
Can you hear me, baby?

28:43.875 --> 28:45.166
My munchkin, can you hear me?

28:45.458 --> 28:46.833
I can't hear a thing.

28:47.166 --> 28:49.000
Now, can you hear me, my dear puppy?

28:49.333 --> 28:50.500
Hello.

28:51.041 --> 28:52.541
Piggy, can you hear me or not?

28:53.000 --> 28:54.416
I don't hear a thing.

28:54.583 --> 28:55.708
I can hear you, dear.

28:58.666 --> 28:59.666
Munchkin, right?

29:00.125 --> 29:02.750
Munchkin sounds good, but I didn't
like piggy. It sounds horrible.

29:24.291 --> 29:26.375
Now, can you hear me, my dear piggy?

29:26.708 --> 29:28.041
I'll talk to you later.

29:40.875 --> 29:41.708
Sir…

29:45.750 --> 29:47.416
-How much?
-Twenty-one rupees, sir.

29:51.041 --> 29:52.041
Here are 20.

29:53.583 --> 29:54.416
Here are two rupees.

29:54.541 --> 29:55.791
-Thank you, sir.
-Excuse me.

29:56.041 --> 29:57.583
-Sir…
-Change, please.

29:58.750 --> 30:01.041
-I don't have one rupee, sir.
-Give me those two rupees.

30:03.291 --> 30:04.250
I'll be back.

30:06.166 --> 30:07.625
Don't flick that.

30:16.083 --> 30:18.291
You've got two minutes.
I want an explanation.

30:37.166 --> 30:38.000
Nope, I didn't find one rupee.

30:39.208 --> 30:40.250
Wait.

30:57.791 --> 30:58.708
So, tell me.

30:59.166 --> 31:01.833
-Dad, there's this guy Pradeep--
-Ask him to meet me tomorrow.

31:07.708 --> 31:08.625
What happened?

31:09.125 --> 31:10.958
Dad has asked you to meet him tomorrow.

31:15.833 --> 31:18.708
Don't worry, we'll rehearse once
before you meet him.

31:20.000 --> 31:20.958
What do you do?

31:21.583 --> 31:24.000
-I work for CTS as Support--
-No, say you're a developer.

31:24.083 --> 31:25.875
-What does your father do?
-He is no more.

31:25.958 --> 31:27.583
-What did he use to do?
-He used to work.

31:27.666 --> 31:29.250
-I mean, what job?
-He had a good job.

31:29.333 --> 31:30.916
-I'll slap you!
-He was a bank clerk.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.375
-Where did you guys meet?
-Facebook.

31:32.458 --> 31:33.291
No! At college!

31:33.583 --> 31:35.541
She's a vegetarian, and you're not.

31:35.625 --> 31:38.291
-I'll eat at a restaurant.
-No, say, "I'll also turn vegetarian."

31:39.833 --> 31:40.750
Look…

31:41.208 --> 31:44.333
talk to an astrologer and make sure you
get a horoscope that matches mine.

31:44.625 --> 31:47.000
Tell him you're a team lead
and earn more than I do.

31:47.083 --> 31:49.375
Next month, you'll be going on-site
to the US and settling there.

31:49.458 --> 31:50.291
Say you like nuclear families.

31:50.375 --> 31:53.416
Don't refuse dowry. Tell him
to give everything to his daughter.

31:53.500 --> 31:56.291
A house in the outskirts by the 80 feet
highway with ample water supply.

31:56.375 --> 31:59.125
Talk with respect in a calm manner,
and do fall at his feet.

31:59.208 --> 32:00.375
Be well groomed, look devotional,

32:00.458 --> 32:02.541
trim your beard,
iron your shirt and tuck it,

32:02.625 --> 32:04.333
and yes, brush twice! That's it!

32:04.416 --> 32:06.625
Then, you'll be my groom!
No one can stop it!

32:15.791 --> 32:16.750
And…

32:17.208 --> 32:19.583
-don't come empty-handed.
-Should I tattoo my hands?

32:19.958 --> 32:22.750
The most important thing,
do not crack such boring jokes.

32:23.125 --> 32:26.416
My dad will also crack such boring jokes.
They'll be horrible,

32:26.500 --> 32:27.375
but do laugh at them.

32:28.125 --> 32:30.458
You must be tensed up,
so you might smoke now.

32:30.541 --> 32:32.333
<i>Don't forget to buy chewing</i>
<i>gum to beat the stench.</i>

32:34.625 --> 32:36.375
I know every single thing about you.

32:38.583 --> 32:40.541
I also know every single
thing about you, baby.

32:40.625 --> 32:41.750
Come again!

32:43.125 --> 32:45.916
Your dad will crack jokes,
and I must laugh.

32:47.083 --> 32:47.916
Yes!

33:00.583 --> 33:01.916
Shweta, chase that dog away.

33:05.833 --> 33:07.083
Venkatapathy, come.

33:09.416 --> 33:10.416
I said, come on.

33:16.666 --> 33:19.250
-I hope Nikitha told you--
-No, she didn't. You tell me.

33:29.833 --> 33:31.291
Uncle, I am Uthaman Pradeep.

33:31.416 --> 33:33.583
-I--
-Can you please speak up?

33:38.333 --> 33:39.875
Uncle, I am Uthaman Pradeep!

33:39.958 --> 33:41.750
I work for CTS as a developer!

33:41.833 --> 33:44.500
A developer who also
developed a relationship!

33:49.708 --> 33:51.041
What a wordplay!

33:52.208 --> 33:53.125
Nice joke, Uncle!

33:53.666 --> 33:55.708
No. That wasn't a joke.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.500
I work for CTS as a developer.

34:05.583 --> 34:07.208
Next year, I'll be working on-site--

34:09.875 --> 34:11.708
-How much?
-Sir, twenty…

34:11.791 --> 34:12.625
Twenty?!

34:13.291 --> 34:14.125
Only 20 rupees, sir.

34:18.458 --> 34:19.375
Why do you want to pay?

34:21.041 --> 34:24.125
You're marrying off your daughter to me,
can't I spare 20 rupees for you?

34:24.541 --> 34:27.083
So, you think you can make
this marriage deal for a mere 20 rupees?

34:30.166 --> 34:32.208
Do you think the cost of my daughter is…

34:33.583 --> 34:34.708
just 20 rupees?

34:40.291 --> 34:41.166
Now, that was a joke.

34:48.833 --> 34:50.750
I'll pay. Please sit down.

34:56.250 --> 34:57.416
-Here are 20 rupees.
-See you, sir.

34:57.750 --> 34:59.958
Excuse me. Here's a one-rupee tip.

35:00.458 --> 35:02.666
It'll be of help during some emergencies.

35:05.416 --> 35:07.708
-Would you like some water?
-Yes, Uncle.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.375
I think I'm a bit nervous. I need it.

35:10.833 --> 35:12.208
Then, please unload the water can.

35:16.083 --> 35:21.250
Uncle, at my house, we pour
the water from the can by tilting it.

35:21.958 --> 35:22.916
How do you do it here?

35:23.125 --> 35:25.583
I have back pain. You must be strong.

35:25.666 --> 35:26.625
Now, unload it.

35:42.333 --> 35:43.416
I'll mop it.

35:46.750 --> 35:47.666
So, where were we?

35:48.041 --> 35:50.083
CTS… developer…

35:51.458 --> 35:54.208
I work for CTS as a developer.

35:54.416 --> 35:57.291
-Did you get your family's consent?
-It's easy. My choice is what matters.

35:57.666 --> 35:59.625
It's not so easy, because here,
my choice is what matters.

36:01.666 --> 36:03.166
-Dear, you missed a spot.
-What?

36:04.208 --> 36:05.750
-Okay.
-Did you notice that?

36:05.833 --> 36:07.250
Yes, Uncle. She missed that spot.

36:07.541 --> 36:09.041
That's my daughter!

36:09.458 --> 36:11.166
She never does thorough work.

36:12.708 --> 36:14.708
But a thorough check is a must, right?

36:15.458 --> 36:17.458
Or else, we'll slip.

36:18.041 --> 36:18.875
True, Uncle.

36:19.875 --> 36:21.250
Then, we must do a thorough check.

36:22.250 --> 36:23.208
Yes, Uncle.

36:23.541 --> 36:24.708
A thorough check!

36:27.166 --> 36:28.041
Yes.

36:28.375 --> 36:29.208
Must check!

36:32.958 --> 36:33.833
Yes.

36:35.583 --> 36:36.541
Must…

36:37.291 --> 36:38.250
Yes.

36:38.708 --> 36:39.791
Then, show me.

36:40.291 --> 36:41.166
Show what?

36:41.833 --> 36:42.666
Your phone.

36:47.375 --> 36:49.125
God, why do you look scared?

36:49.375 --> 36:52.583
Just for one day,
you both swap your phones.

36:53.333 --> 36:55.291
Come back here tomorrow at the same time.

36:55.583 --> 36:58.125
If you both still go ahead with
the relationship, I'll have no issues.

37:01.750 --> 37:07.250
Eight of this month…

37:08.541 --> 37:09.500
Yes!

37:09.833 --> 37:12.708
Then, after four days, come with your
family and ask her hand in marriage.

37:13.083 --> 37:14.916
I'll cancel the alliance
that I had set up.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.166
If you don't agree to this…

37:17.541 --> 37:20.000
then it ends here.
Don't even think about marrying her.

37:21.208 --> 37:24.083
The boy that I've selected
will come on the same day

37:24.166 --> 37:26.375
along with his family
to ask your hand in marriage.

37:27.916 --> 37:28.916
Okay?

37:30.166 --> 37:31.041
Okay?

37:31.666 --> 37:32.625
Nice, right?

37:37.958 --> 37:39.750
You're joking, right?

37:41.291 --> 37:42.708
Uncle, you're always joking.

37:42.791 --> 37:44.791
No, I'm very serious about this.

37:47.333 --> 37:49.583
I am not making a fuss
like the usual parents.

37:50.041 --> 37:51.583
-I didn't ask your caste
-Dad…

37:51.666 --> 37:53.000
or family status.

37:53.791 --> 37:54.625
Just a phone!

37:56.291 --> 37:58.375
Just a phone swap! That's all!

37:58.708 --> 38:01.875
Don't you guys already
know each other very well?

38:10.916 --> 38:11.750
Okay, Uncle.

38:13.500 --> 38:14.625
Uncle, can I use the restroom?

38:14.708 --> 38:16.166
-Yeah.
-Thanks, Uncle.

38:17.166 --> 38:19.208
-Go straight, and--
-Take a right, and it'll be in the corner.

38:25.541 --> 38:27.083
Can you please leave your phone here?

38:55.333 --> 38:56.166
Aren't you going?

38:56.333 --> 38:57.250
No, I'm good.

38:57.708 --> 38:58.625
And that's why you won't go.

39:56.583 --> 39:58.916
Okay, Uncle. I'll leave now.

40:13.708 --> 40:14.541
Who's calling?

40:14.625 --> 40:16.166
-Must be our PM!
-No, Uncle.

40:16.416 --> 40:20.833
He is calling you to discuss
the revision of the petrol price.

40:30.208 --> 40:31.416
Mom, where is your phone?

40:36.000 --> 40:37.833
Give it to me. I said, give it to me.

40:37.916 --> 40:40.541
-Pulthish, give it to me!
-No, I won't!

40:47.250 --> 40:48.625
-Hello.
-Who's this?

40:48.833 --> 40:50.500
It's me, Nikitha.

40:50.625 --> 40:51.666
What's with the new number?

40:52.375 --> 40:53.708
That's the issue, buddy.

40:55.625 --> 40:56.708
What the hell!

40:57.208 --> 40:59.041
Yes, dude. If she opens it, I'm doomed.

40:59.375 --> 41:01.208
He still doesn't know my unlock pattern.

41:01.291 --> 41:03.458
She'll ask for the unlock
pattern any moment.

41:03.750 --> 41:06.208
Before that, give me an idea
to make her return my phone.

41:06.875 --> 41:07.916
Passport verification!

41:08.375 --> 41:10.666
Let's stage a play that Pradeep is going
to get a call from the passport office.

41:11.500 --> 41:15.541
Hey, for passport verification, they'll
come to my house, they won't call me.

41:15.791 --> 41:17.958
This idea sounds like a fool's idea!

41:18.041 --> 41:18.958
Crappy idea!

41:19.375 --> 41:21.875
My uncle's an inspector. We can lock
your phone using the IMEI number.

41:21.958 --> 41:23.791
Awesome, dude. Do that first.

41:24.333 --> 41:26.750
It can be done, but first, lodge
a complaint that the phone is lost.

41:27.666 --> 41:30.916
Within one week, we can block
the phone from being used.

41:31.708 --> 41:32.625
Okay, Uncle.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.416
Once she finds out your pattern,
she'll block you tonight!

41:35.791 --> 41:38.500
Your sister's wedding is in four days!
What are you doing there?

41:38.583 --> 41:39.708
Coming, Mom.

41:42.125 --> 41:44.041
-You're on to something.
-My sister's wedding!

41:44.125 --> 41:44.958
What about it?

41:45.041 --> 41:48.166
I'll get a lot of calls on my number.

41:48.583 --> 41:50.625
-You guys will be making all those calls!
-Us?!

41:50.958 --> 41:52.083
Bombard her with so many calls…

41:52.458 --> 41:57.083
that she must think my sister's wedding
won't take place without my phone.

41:57.250 --> 41:58.166
I got it!

42:01.958 --> 42:03.750
Hello, dude, where are you?

42:13.375 --> 42:15.458
-Hello?
-I'm calling from the catering service.

42:15.541 --> 42:18.333
Onion's price is rising.
Shall we replace it with cucumber?

42:18.875 --> 42:20.166
Sir, Pradeep is not here.

42:20.250 --> 42:22.250
I'll give you another number.
Call him on that number.

42:22.333 --> 42:24.166
Hurry up, the onion's price
increased by two rupees.

42:24.250 --> 42:25.250
Yeah, wait.

42:30.041 --> 42:32.250
-Hello?
-Sir, this is Murugan

42:32.333 --> 42:34.083
from the wedding hall service.
What kind of decoration do you want?

42:34.166 --> 42:35.833
Sir, Pradeep is not here.

42:35.916 --> 42:37.833
Hello, I'm calling
from the chariot service.

42:37.916 --> 42:40.083
-I'm calling from Lakme Salon.
-I'm calling from decoration services.

42:40.166 --> 42:41.791
-I'm calling from here!
-I'm calling from there!

42:41.875 --> 42:43.041
From where?

42:43.125 --> 42:45.333
Say you're calling
from the wedding hall, darling.

42:45.416 --> 42:47.000
You don't know my service experience!

42:47.083 --> 42:49.375
Should we go to the hall and do
the makeup or do it and then go?

42:49.458 --> 42:52.166
Real flowers are way too costly.
How about fake plastic flowers?

42:52.250 --> 42:54.916
-What decorations do you want?
-You just called me a while ago.

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
All I'm saying is that I have
20 years of experience in this field.

42:58.541 --> 43:00.833
-How about lions instead of horses?
-I didn't get you.

43:00.916 --> 43:02.250
Give the phone
to someone who will get it.

43:02.333 --> 43:04.208
It'd be helpful if you pay the advance.

43:04.291 --> 43:06.208
Listen to me, don't interrupt!

43:06.291 --> 43:08.833
Dear, I have arrived at Egmore Station.

43:08.916 --> 43:10.708
Come and pick me up.

43:10.791 --> 43:12.583
You silly, that's how I talk!

43:12.666 --> 43:17.416
-Instead of playing a Gaana song…
-How about a melody?

43:17.708 --> 43:20.750
He changed his number?!
Are you trying to cheat me?

43:20.833 --> 43:23.208
<i>He must call me at once,</i>
<i>or I'll go to the police!</i>

43:24.791 --> 43:27.375
Wait and watch. In some time--

43:38.583 --> 43:39.666
<i>-Hello.</i>
-Hello.

43:39.916 --> 43:41.000
<i>May I speak to Nikitha?</i>

43:41.208 --> 43:43.291
<i>This is a call regarding</i>
<i>her passport verification.</i>

43:45.000 --> 43:45.916
<i>Hello?</i>

43:47.250 --> 43:49.666
<i>-Hello!</i>
-Answer him.

43:49.750 --> 43:51.000
<i>-Hello.</i>
-Talk to him.

43:53.375 --> 43:55.833
She has gone out.
I'll give you another number.

43:55.916 --> 43:57.041
You can call her on that number.

43:57.125 --> 43:57.958
<i>Are you kidding?</i>

43:58.041 --> 43:59.708
<i>For verification,</i>
<i>we'll need her registered number.</i>

43:59.791 --> 44:00.916
<i>Give her the phone!</i>

44:03.916 --> 44:06.083
Give me two minutes.

44:06.166 --> 44:07.916
I'll sprint to her place
and give it to her.

44:08.000 --> 44:09.208
<i>Make it fast.</i>

44:10.208 --> 44:12.125
-That's the idea we rejected.
-That was my idea.

44:13.041 --> 44:14.833
-Yes!
-What if it's for real?

44:14.916 --> 44:17.083
You mocked Bhaskar
for giving you this idea.

44:17.166 --> 44:19.750
Chill. I hope you realized it now.

44:20.958 --> 44:22.750
They are trying to overtake us.

44:22.833 --> 44:23.958
Watch me take over them.

44:29.583 --> 44:31.333
Hello, Pradeep. There's an emergency.

44:31.416 --> 44:32.291
What happened?

44:32.375 --> 44:35.250
It's Jackie from Bosch.
There is an emergency situation.

44:35.333 --> 44:37.750
<i>-Pradeep has to be here. Where is he?</i>
-What's the problem?

44:37.833 --> 44:40.458
Why the hell do I have to say to you?
Give the phone to Pradeep! Bullshit!

44:41.500 --> 44:42.416
She's petrified.

44:44.500 --> 44:46.750
Hey, you're Bhaskar, right?

44:47.875 --> 44:49.583
Sister, how did you find out?

44:49.833 --> 44:53.208
He has saved your contact
as "Liar Bhaskar."

45:04.500 --> 45:05.541
Did she agree to give me the phone?

45:06.125 --> 45:08.000
You saved my contact as "Liar Bhaskar"?!

45:08.083 --> 45:10.041
Why did you call her from your phone?

45:10.125 --> 45:11.458
My number in your phone--

45:11.833 --> 45:14.750
-How have you saved my contact?
-Don't dig your own grave.

45:14.833 --> 45:15.666
Her father's calling.

45:20.000 --> 45:20.833
Hello, Uncle.

45:21.083 --> 45:22.208
It's me.

45:23.458 --> 45:24.583
Thank God it's you.

45:24.958 --> 45:25.958
Sorry, Pradeep.

45:26.041 --> 45:28.250
My dad has put our love to the test.

45:28.500 --> 45:31.500
Don't I know you? This is unnecessary.

45:32.416 --> 45:34.125
I feel the same way, Nikki.

45:34.458 --> 45:36.750
Shall I return your phone
and get mine back?

45:36.958 --> 45:40.541
We'll prove our true love in front of my
father tomorrow and then exchange it.

45:42.208 --> 45:43.041
Fine.

45:43.875 --> 45:45.875
Well, I will not dig
into your phone anyway.

45:46.958 --> 45:49.208
Me neither. Okay, bye. My dad's coming.

45:54.250 --> 45:56.041
What's making him dance
in such a horrible way?

45:57.125 --> 45:58.708
Dude, finally, some peace.

45:59.791 --> 46:02.291
Imagine if she had unlocked
my phone and checked it!

46:03.250 --> 46:06.041
Well, I understand why you're afraid…

46:06.708 --> 46:07.666
but why is she afraid?

46:11.083 --> 46:13.291
Dude, you trust her, right?

46:14.291 --> 46:15.958
-Yes.
-But your face tells me otherwise.

46:16.041 --> 46:16.958
I trust her.

46:17.041 --> 46:19.416
Then, switch off the phone
and go to sleep. Right?

46:19.500 --> 46:21.166
No. You trust her, right?

46:21.416 --> 46:22.458
Then, just dig into it.

46:26.666 --> 46:28.041
That'd be wrong, right?

46:28.208 --> 46:29.208
It'd be a blunder!

46:29.458 --> 46:31.416
Only cheapos who doubt their
girlfriends do such things.

46:31.500 --> 46:33.958
Hey, he'd be a cheapo only if
he doubts her and checks it.

46:34.125 --> 46:36.958
If he doesn't doubt her and still
checks it, then that means he's a man.

46:37.041 --> 46:39.916
Digging into it means he doubts her.
It's a shame.

46:40.000 --> 46:42.500
Only if he digs in will we know
if it's shameful or not!

46:42.583 --> 46:45.375
Dude, don't dig in.
I'm telling you for your own good.

46:45.458 --> 46:48.125
Do you think Nikitha
won't dig into your phone?

46:49.208 --> 46:50.041
No.

46:50.625 --> 46:53.291
I know every little thing about Nikitha.
She won't check my phone.

46:56.791 --> 46:58.291
<i>Tell me your phone's unlock pattern.</i>

46:58.583 --> 47:01.083
Nikitha, first, your dad was
being foolish, and now, you--

47:01.166 --> 47:03.958
Dear, it's me. Nikitha's dad.

47:04.041 --> 47:05.333
The phone's on speakerphone…

47:05.541 --> 47:07.708
but I don't mind.
Now, unlock pattern, please.

47:08.708 --> 47:09.541
Uncle, seven.

47:12.000 --> 47:12.958
No, it didn't work.

47:13.375 --> 47:14.375
Slanting seven, Uncle.

47:17.166 --> 47:18.125
It's unlocked.

47:18.500 --> 47:20.916
Listen, Nikitha's pattern
is slightly complicated.

47:21.250 --> 47:24.875
We'll send the pattern's screenshot
on your mom's phone. Take care. Bye.

47:25.708 --> 47:26.583
Bye, Uncle.

47:35.416 --> 47:36.291
Pattern!

49:18.750 --> 49:20.250
You have a weird, peculiar taste.

49:20.958 --> 49:22.625
-You agreed because he's a doctor?!
-No!

49:22.833 --> 49:23.916
I'm not after his money.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.166
-Then give me at least one reason--
-I'll give three.

49:26.875 --> 49:28.208
When he came here to meet me…

49:29.041 --> 49:29.958
Please sit.

49:32.958 --> 49:33.958
So, tell me.

49:34.791 --> 49:36.583
-Sorry.
-No, please go ahead.

49:37.333 --> 49:38.208
It's okay.

49:38.291 --> 49:39.750
Please. Answer the call.

49:41.041 --> 49:43.291
<i>Reason one, he's kindhearted.</i>

49:44.750 --> 49:45.750
Answer the call, okay?

49:48.541 --> 49:49.375
Tell me.

49:50.458 --> 49:53.208
Hold on. Where are you going?
You can stay here.

49:53.291 --> 49:55.166
What if you guys want some privacy?

49:55.666 --> 49:56.583
Go ahead.

49:58.083 --> 50:00.625
<i>Reason two,</i>
<i>he respects me and gives me my space.</i>

50:02.083 --> 50:03.416
<i>2,7 meters.</i>

50:08.541 --> 50:09.541
Okay, bye.

50:10.416 --> 50:11.250
I'm done.

50:12.041 --> 50:13.041
Are you done with the call?

50:17.625 --> 50:18.458
Now, can we talk?

50:24.416 --> 50:27.541
I'll answer calls before getting
into a conversation, but once it starts,

50:27.625 --> 50:29.625
you'll have my full attention.

50:30.458 --> 50:33.208
<i>Reason three, he made me his top priority.</i>

50:33.833 --> 50:35.333
Tea is going cold. Can we have it?

50:35.791 --> 50:36.625
Please have it.

50:39.041 --> 50:40.791
What else do I need?

50:42.416 --> 50:43.958
So, he's an excellent catch!

50:45.416 --> 50:47.041
But I won't get caught.

50:47.625 --> 50:52.458
Her dad won't even know
about the "Delete" option on the phone.

50:52.833 --> 50:55.375
I deleted all my chats last
night before I went to bed.

51:05.291 --> 51:07.875
Dad, Shweta,

51:08.250 --> 51:09.791
cousin brother…

51:09.875 --> 51:10.708
"Coming"?!

51:12.833 --> 51:16.041
<i>-Let's play Ludo. Coming?</i>
-"Let's play Ludo. Coming?"

51:16.583 --> 51:17.541
Okay.

51:22.625 --> 51:24.291
Not Ravi, it's Revi.

51:25.000 --> 51:28.125
<i>Revi!</i>

51:38.416 --> 51:39.708
First, listen to me.

51:40.208 --> 51:42.041
"Girl, when I saw you first…

51:42.791 --> 51:44.250
I wondered if God knew
what he was really doing.

51:45.125 --> 51:47.625
But when I checked you
out, I was awestruck.

51:48.250 --> 51:49.583
I realized God is actually generous."

51:49.666 --> 51:51.125
Nice lines, right?

51:51.291 --> 51:52.250
They suit you the best.

51:53.000 --> 51:53.833
I didn't get it.

51:54.041 --> 51:56.125
Seriously, you still didn't
get my point, Nikki?!

51:56.500 --> 51:59.791
I live in Ramapuram, yet I come all
the way to Rasipuram to pick you up,

51:59.875 --> 52:01.416
and I drop you off
all the way in Ramanathapuram.

52:01.875 --> 52:03.708
Everyone around me asks me if I'm jobless.

52:04.416 --> 52:05.750
Meeting you is my full-time job.

52:06.708 --> 52:08.291
I post Yuvan's song
in my status just for you.

52:08.875 --> 52:11.708
I get a notification when you see it.
I'm not pointing it out…

52:12.333 --> 52:14.375
but I'm proposing to you.

52:16.625 --> 52:18.166
You pierced your nose
just because I like it.

52:18.750 --> 52:19.875
Isn't this love?

52:20.291 --> 52:22.333
Hey, I'm in a relationship with Pradeep.

52:22.875 --> 52:25.833
But you told me that you guys fought,
and you're not talking to each other.

52:26.875 --> 52:28.583
It's complicated.

52:29.000 --> 52:32.041
Nikki, I don't know if I'll ever
get a better chance than this.

52:33.541 --> 52:35.000
I love you so much!

52:35.583 --> 52:38.833
All I do every day is talk
about Pradeep to you.

52:38.916 --> 52:40.166
First, stop that, Nikki!

52:40.416 --> 52:41.958
Don't talk about him to me!

52:43.125 --> 52:46.958
On every full moon,
when I drop you off to him,

52:47.041 --> 52:50.041
the way you both wave goodbye to me…

52:50.333 --> 52:54.583
makes me feel like I'm lost in
the pitch dark during that bright night.

52:55.750 --> 52:58.125
To forget him, first,
you must stop talking about him!

52:58.750 --> 52:59.708
I love you…

53:00.958 --> 53:01.875
but as a friend.

53:05.041 --> 53:06.000
It's okay, Nikki.

53:06.666 --> 53:08.000
I don't care whom you're
in a relationship with.

53:08.916 --> 53:11.791
But until my last breath,
I'll only love you.

53:12.625 --> 53:15.875
Sorry, I never knew you were
so deeply in love with me.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.166
Don't stop talking to me because of this.

53:18.541 --> 53:21.208
I need you by my side forever, dear.
Please.

53:21.291 --> 53:22.125
I'll try.

53:22.208 --> 53:25.583
With a girl like you around,
it is hard to control one's feelings.

53:26.458 --> 53:28.000
I hope he'll take good care of you.

53:28.166 --> 53:30.625
If he breaks your heart,
I'll break his face!

53:34.041 --> 53:35.666
I don't deserve you, darling.

53:52.208 --> 53:53.041
Hello.

53:53.791 --> 53:54.958
Who is Revi?

53:55.041 --> 53:57.041
Don't you know? He's my friend.

53:57.333 --> 54:00.166
He's your friend, but who are you to him?

54:00.541 --> 54:03.208
He proposed to you,
and you didn't tell me anything about it?!

54:03.791 --> 54:05.875
But I didn't accept his proposal.

54:05.958 --> 54:08.375
You didn't reject it either.

54:09.250 --> 54:11.791
He said he'd break my face,
and you sent him a heart emoji!

54:12.000 --> 54:13.125
<i>Do you want to break my face?</i>

54:13.208 --> 54:15.208
He will break my face?! He?!

54:15.291 --> 54:16.791
I'll fucking finish off that buffoon!

54:16.875 --> 54:19.875
I didn't send him a heart emoji for that,
I sent it for his caringness.

54:20.333 --> 54:21.916
So, breaking my face
means he cares for you?!

54:22.583 --> 54:24.500
-Hey--
-And what was that? Wait, hold on.

54:26.416 --> 54:30.166
"Sorry, I never knew you were
so deeply in love with me."

54:33.416 --> 54:34.583
What would you have done if you knew?

54:36.333 --> 54:38.208
I didn't mean to say that…

54:39.666 --> 54:41.250
What would you have done if you knew?

54:42.916 --> 54:44.500
You told me he's like a brother!

54:44.916 --> 54:46.333
A brother proposes to his sister?!

54:46.416 --> 54:47.541
When did I tell you he's like my brother?

54:48.333 --> 54:50.250
On the day of my sister's engagement.

54:50.333 --> 54:51.625
No, I said he's a friend.

54:52.458 --> 54:54.875
Nikitha, I swear…

54:55.541 --> 54:58.166
-you said he's like your brother.
-I swear, I said he's a friend.

54:59.125 --> 55:02.291
I am very sure,
and I remember what you said.

55:02.500 --> 55:04.416
You said he's like your brother.

55:04.750 --> 55:06.708
I also remember very well.
I told you he's my friend.

55:07.250 --> 55:09.583
Nikitha, you lie like crap!

55:09.666 --> 55:10.500
<i>Like crap!</i>

55:10.583 --> 55:12.041
Go ahead, lie!

55:12.125 --> 55:13.833
Remember you made me pierce my ear?

55:13.916 --> 55:16.000
But you pierced your nose
for him and made me a fool!

55:16.583 --> 55:17.416
Okay, so, tell me,

55:18.541 --> 55:19.375
who is Saranya?

55:21.083 --> 55:21.916
Saranya?

55:22.166 --> 55:24.208
You've sent her 20 rupees on Google Pay.

55:24.291 --> 55:25.916
<i>I'm talking about that Saranya.</i>

55:27.000 --> 55:29.458
Oh, her? She's a stranger.

55:29.541 --> 55:31.125
She was stranded and helpless.

55:31.208 --> 55:33.791
So, I sent her 20 rupees
as I didn't have cash with me. Yeah.

55:33.875 --> 55:35.250
They, why did you send her
a "Hi" in the evening?

55:45.041 --> 55:47.166
Okay, I'll tell you the truth.
She's my ex.

55:47.250 --> 55:48.625
What? Sophie is your ex, right?

55:49.291 --> 55:51.416
Yeah, but so is Saranya.
You can call her "small ex."

55:51.541 --> 55:53.041
You stopped talking to all
your exes, didn't you?

55:53.125 --> 55:55.083
I was blocked everywhere,
so I couldn't talk.

55:55.166 --> 55:56.750
Then, why did you send her 20 rupees?

55:56.833 --> 55:58.625
I told you, she had blocked me everywhere.

55:58.958 --> 56:00.625
So, I sent her 20 rupees on GPay…

56:00.708 --> 56:02.625
and thought of starting
a conversation with

56:02.708 --> 56:04.666
"Sent by mistake. Please send it back,"

56:04.750 --> 56:07.208
but she didn't respond at all.
Twenty rupees loss.

56:07.583 --> 56:10.583
-You cheapo!
-I am cheap but not as cheap as you!

56:10.666 --> 56:13.000
Don't divert the focus to 20 rupees!
Don't make a U-turn!

56:13.083 --> 56:14.833
How dare he say that
he'll break my face?

56:15.166 --> 56:18.125
And what did you say? "I need you
by my side forever, dear. Please."

56:19.291 --> 56:20.958
I was trying to give
him emotional support.

56:21.541 --> 56:22.625
Emotional support?

56:23.083 --> 56:25.291
He says he'll break your boyfriend's face…

56:25.375 --> 56:27.041
and you're giving him emotional support?!

56:27.125 --> 56:28.833
How can you talk like that?

56:28.916 --> 56:30.916
-Try to understand--
-Dear!

56:31.875 --> 56:33.791
It's getting late. It's time to eat.

56:34.750 --> 56:36.000
Wait. I'll have dinner and come back.

56:36.083 --> 56:40.250
Have dinner and come back?! You break
my heart, and you want to have dinner?!

56:40.333 --> 56:44.000
Vegetarian food can wait!
He wants to break my face! How dare he?

56:44.083 --> 56:45.458
Answer me!

56:56.750 --> 56:58.666
Do you really have to tell me all this?

56:58.916 --> 57:00.250
Don't I know you?

57:00.500 --> 57:02.708
You have the right to ask me anything,
and it's my duty to tell you.

57:03.041 --> 57:04.416
Okay. Hold on.

57:04.500 --> 57:07.208
AUNT RANI
INCOMING VOICE CALL

57:07.291 --> 57:10.000
My aunt, Rani, is calling. I'll put
you on a conference call with her.

57:10.083 --> 57:11.041
Hey…

57:11.916 --> 57:13.250
but why?

57:13.333 --> 57:16.541
You're family now. You can be
part of our family conversations.

57:16.625 --> 57:17.583
God!

57:18.500 --> 57:19.666
Fine, go ahead.

57:23.125 --> 57:25.333
-Auntie…
-Hello, dear.

57:25.541 --> 57:27.291
-How are you?
-I'm fine.

57:27.541 --> 57:31.708
By the way,
your groom looks dark and handsome!

57:31.875 --> 57:34.500
You're one lucky girl.
Fine, give the phone to your mom.

57:34.708 --> 57:35.666
Just a minute.

57:37.125 --> 57:39.083
-Doctor, his tooth--
-Remove it.

57:39.166 --> 57:40.083
Okay.

57:40.458 --> 57:42.250
Mom, it's Aunt Rani.

57:44.083 --> 57:45.166
-Hello.
<i>-Hello.</i>

57:45.250 --> 57:47.041
Rani, how are you?

57:47.166 --> 57:49.375
Is this the best groom you could find?

57:49.458 --> 57:52.666
He looks like a pregnant wild boar!
You want <i>him</i> as your son-in-law?!

57:52.750 --> 57:54.375
Hey, what can I do?

57:54.458 --> 57:56.916
Divya likes him. Then, what can I say?

57:57.000 --> 57:58.458
She chose him, and I agreed to it.

57:58.541 --> 58:01.041
Why do girls of this generation
have such bad taste?

58:01.125 --> 58:03.666
He looks worse than your high
school boyfriend, Kanniyappan.

58:03.750 --> 58:06.666
Is that so? He's better than your
high school boyfriend, Munnusamy!

58:17.791 --> 58:18.833
Fine, leave it.

58:18.916 --> 58:20.833
Let's not waste time
talking about Kanniyappan.

58:22.416 --> 58:23.958
Okay, Divya is coming.

58:24.791 --> 58:26.000
-Here you go, dear.
-Yeah.

58:26.708 --> 58:28.500
Fine, we'll meet at the wedding.

58:30.291 --> 58:32.416
Hello, tell me.
What were they talking about?

58:34.208 --> 58:35.083
Hello?

58:36.750 --> 58:37.625
<i>Hello?</i>

58:39.166 --> 58:40.458
<i>-Hello!</i>
-I removed it, doctor.

58:49.750 --> 58:52.166
"Baby, forget what
happened the other day."

58:52.750 --> 58:53.750
Baby?!

58:59.916 --> 59:00.791
No…

59:08.375 --> 59:10.583
Close your eyes and give me a kiss.

59:10.666 --> 59:11.541
<i>Now?</i>

59:19.500 --> 59:20.916
-What?
-Do you have the C-type charger?

59:21.000 --> 59:22.375
<i>-Say no.</i>
-No!

59:23.541 --> 59:24.541
<i>Now, back to kissing.</i>

59:27.666 --> 59:29.500
-What are you looking for?
-The C-type charger.

59:29.625 --> 59:30.583
What's that now?

59:36.208 --> 59:37.208
Charger.

59:38.125 --> 59:39.166
The normal type.

59:41.166 --> 59:44.916
If there's a power cut, then use this
power bank with a 20,000 mAh battery.

59:59.208 --> 01:00:00.208
Do you have the C-type charger?

01:00:20.041 --> 01:00:22.541
Who could it be at this hour?

01:00:26.708 --> 01:00:28.125
I need the C-type charger.

01:00:29.791 --> 01:00:31.208
What's with the ostrich walk?

01:00:39.416 --> 01:00:41.625
-Oh, no. Cover your eyes.
-It's his tee.

01:00:46.291 --> 01:00:47.208
Dude!

01:00:47.708 --> 01:00:49.041
I just put my phone on charge.

01:00:49.458 --> 01:00:51.500
I need it for the whole night.
I hope you understand.

01:00:51.583 --> 01:00:52.458
Gross!

01:00:54.875 --> 01:00:56.333
-Here, take this.
-Thanks.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.583
-At least for ten minutes--
-Back off!

01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:04.833
-What's that?
-Hey!

01:01:05.083 --> 01:01:06.125
Go back to sleep.

01:01:06.208 --> 01:01:07.875
I wanted to check if you need any help.

01:01:10.291 --> 01:01:12.875
<i>Baby, what's up?</i>

01:01:17.458 --> 01:01:19.833
Buddy…

01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:23.291
there is a person called "Mamakutty."

01:01:25.916 --> 01:01:27.541
He sent her a message calling her "Baby."

01:01:28.583 --> 01:01:30.250
But that's the only
message in the chat window.

01:01:31.833 --> 01:01:33.458
So, she deleted the old chats, right?

01:01:43.541 --> 01:01:45.208
<i>Hi, dear. Awake?</i>

01:01:48.583 --> 01:01:50.500
Buddy…

01:01:51.875 --> 01:01:53.375
the message hasn't been delivered.

01:01:53.791 --> 01:01:55.208
I guess he slept.

01:01:56.666 --> 01:01:59.875
Then, you also go to sleep. It's 3:00 a.m.

01:02:07.833 --> 01:02:10.583
<i>The special kiss</i>
<i>Is reserved for you</i>

01:02:10.666 --> 01:02:13.625
<i>The other half of my bed</i>
<i>Is reserved for you</i>

01:02:13.708 --> 01:02:16.791
<i>My heart is reserved for you</i>

01:02:17.125 --> 01:02:20.166
<i>-This honey is for you</i>
<i>-I am yours</i>

01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:23.291
<i>Honey, I am all yours</i>

01:02:27.583 --> 01:02:29.666
Heard that? The other half of
her bed is reserved for him.

01:02:30.458 --> 01:02:32.291
I guess you could make do with her half!

01:02:52.250 --> 01:02:54.208
It's been a long time since I--
How about having--

01:02:55.291 --> 01:02:56.208
What?

01:02:56.458 --> 01:02:59.375
Sorry, typo. It's been a long time
since I met you. Can we meet?

01:02:59.458 --> 01:03:00.333
Oh.

01:03:03.250 --> 01:03:04.916
Sorry, pressed by mistake.

01:03:06.041 --> 01:03:07.750
You look sleazy in that sleeveless top.

01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:10.166
Sorry, wrong chat box.

01:03:10.958 --> 01:03:11.833
It's okay.

01:03:12.583 --> 01:03:14.916
It's been a long time
since I heard your voice.

01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:16.583
Why can't you sing a song for me?

01:03:17.125 --> 01:03:18.625
I can't sing now.

01:03:18.791 --> 01:03:19.958
Dad's right next to me.

01:03:23.791 --> 01:03:24.916
You sang really well.

01:03:26.458 --> 01:03:29.000
-I don't get it.
-The way you spoke was a song to my ears.

01:03:34.291 --> 01:03:37.250
If your voice had a physical form,
I would've kissed it all day long,

01:03:37.333 --> 01:03:40.750
but unfortunately, it doesn't,
and it comes from the vocal cord.

01:03:41.125 --> 01:03:43.541
I wish I could live inside your vocal
cord until my last breath, Nikki.

01:03:44.708 --> 01:03:46.666
Oh, please don't give me that look.

01:03:48.125 --> 01:03:50.916
Had your food?

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:51.958
Hope you ate.

01:03:52.791 --> 01:03:54.583
Please reply!

01:03:54.666 --> 01:03:55.833
Are you single?

01:03:56.875 --> 01:03:57.916
How about this pose?

01:03:58.375 --> 01:03:59.208
Please reply.

01:03:59.791 --> 01:04:00.625
Wanna hang out?

01:04:00.708 --> 01:04:02.291
I offered prayers in your name.

01:04:02.666 --> 01:04:05.000
Please reply, or I'll cast
a voodoo magic spell on you.

01:04:05.375 --> 01:04:07.375
You're online! Can't you give a reply?

01:04:07.458 --> 01:04:08.833
I'll slit my wrist! Please reply!

01:04:08.916 --> 01:04:09.916
Can you send a pic?

01:04:10.041 --> 01:04:11.458
I'll slit myself! Please reply!

01:04:11.541 --> 01:04:12.541
Come and feed me food.

01:04:13.791 --> 01:04:15.250
Good morning. Good night.

01:04:15.333 --> 01:04:16.458
I'll hang myself.

01:04:16.541 --> 01:04:17.625
How about sharing a joint?

01:04:17.916 --> 01:04:19.750
So, you blocked me?!

01:04:19.833 --> 01:04:22.083
Are you falling for my mustache?

01:04:23.250 --> 01:04:24.333
Let's go clubbing!

01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:25.875
Let's have some fun!

01:04:26.166 --> 01:04:28.166
What's up? Any plans?

01:04:28.666 --> 01:04:29.708
You have a boyfriend, right?

01:04:29.791 --> 01:04:32.500
That's why you aren't replying!
I'll break his head!

01:04:33.458 --> 01:04:35.125
What's up? What doing?

01:04:35.208 --> 01:04:37.125
I want to die, Nikki! Come on!

01:04:37.208 --> 01:04:40.500
Please reply!

01:04:40.583 --> 01:04:44.250
-I want to die, Nikki! Come on!
-Please reply!

01:04:44.333 --> 01:04:50.291
-I want to die, Nikki! Come on!
-Please reply!

01:05:01.708 --> 01:05:02.791
What happened?

01:05:04.458 --> 01:05:06.625
Your sister called saying
it's time for the function.

01:05:14.875 --> 01:05:16.125
-Hi.
-Hi, Pulthish.

01:05:19.208 --> 01:05:20.208
It'll take more time.

01:05:21.916 --> 01:05:24.291
Hey, why are you in this attire?

01:05:24.958 --> 01:05:26.583
New phone?

01:05:26.666 --> 01:05:27.833
When did you buy it?

01:05:31.791 --> 01:05:33.541
Is that Yogi's phone ringing?

01:05:34.208 --> 01:05:35.375
What do you mean?

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:37.916
It's just a phone. Calm down.

01:05:38.750 --> 01:05:40.916
Just a phone?
You'll realize it if it happens to you.

01:05:57.041 --> 01:05:59.500
He has been getting constant calls.

01:05:59.875 --> 01:06:01.625
Answer it and tell them he's in the loo.

01:06:01.875 --> 01:06:03.750
It's okay. Let him come.

01:06:03.833 --> 01:06:06.833
Come on, he's your fiancé.

01:06:06.916 --> 01:06:08.250
Answer it.

01:06:09.125 --> 01:06:10.125
Answer it, dear.

01:06:11.125 --> 01:06:14.625
-Answer it, dear.
-Come on, it's okay.

01:06:35.708 --> 01:06:37.708
What did I do now to get
that reaction from him?

01:06:38.125 --> 01:06:39.708
Really? He reacted like that?!

01:06:40.375 --> 01:06:42.333
That reaction is not a good sign.

01:06:42.666 --> 01:06:44.250
You guys aren't even married,
and he reacted like that!

01:06:44.625 --> 01:06:46.458
I wonder how he'd react after marriage!

01:07:04.291 --> 01:07:05.541
Sorry, baby girl.

01:07:05.833 --> 01:07:07.000
I fell asleep last night.

01:07:13.666 --> 01:07:15.000
<i>No problem…</i>

01:07:16.291 --> 01:07:17.166
<i>baby.</i>

01:07:21.333 --> 01:07:22.166
Baby?!

01:07:23.125 --> 01:07:24.708
That's new. How come?

01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:27.000
You never address me like that.

01:07:27.833 --> 01:07:29.458
You address me as "darling," don't you?

01:07:32.708 --> 01:07:34.416
<i>Fine, tell me, darling.</i>

01:07:34.791 --> 01:07:36.541
<i>Why did you message me yesterday?</i>

01:07:36.833 --> 01:07:39.750
Well, I didn't get any message
from my baby girl yesterday…

01:07:40.333 --> 01:07:43.041
so I thought she got upset
with me the day before yesterday.

01:07:43.833 --> 01:07:44.958
Please forget that.

01:07:45.708 --> 01:07:48.333
The day before yesterday,
I didn't mean to talk like that.

01:07:49.416 --> 01:07:50.958
<i>Didn't mean to talk like that?!</i>

01:07:52.333 --> 01:07:56.291
<i>No, I don't remember. Can you please</i>
<i>tell me what you're talking about?</i>

01:07:56.375 --> 01:07:57.791
Ever since our breakup…

01:07:58.208 --> 01:08:00.583
I've recorded all our calls.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:01.916
As your memory.

01:08:02.791 --> 01:08:05.416
<i>Awesome! Can you send them to me?</i>

01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:07.083
<i>I'll also keep them as your memory.</i>

01:08:07.375 --> 01:08:08.666
In a second, baby girl.

01:08:20.208 --> 01:08:21.250
Hey, baby girl.

01:08:21.333 --> 01:08:24.583
Tell me, Mamakutty.
Why did you call me at this hour?

01:08:24.666 --> 01:08:25.916
I am lost in your thoughts.

01:08:26.416 --> 01:08:27.833
How about another long drive?

01:08:28.750 --> 01:08:29.583
<i>What now?</i>

01:08:30.875 --> 01:08:31.708
<i>Hey, baby girl.</i>

01:08:31.791 --> 01:08:35.041
<i>Tell me, Mamakutty.</i>

01:08:35.125 --> 01:08:36.375
<i>I'm lost in your thoughts.</i>

01:08:36.875 --> 01:08:40.000
<i>How about another long drive?</i>

01:08:40.083 --> 01:08:42.958
<i>How about another long drive?</i>

01:08:44.333 --> 01:08:48.416
<i>Tell me, Mamakutty!</i>

01:08:48.750 --> 01:08:50.125
<i>How about another long drive?</i>

01:08:50.625 --> 01:08:54.958
<i>Tell me, Mamakutty!</i>

01:08:55.083 --> 01:08:56.708
<i>How about another long drive?</i>

01:09:22.333 --> 01:09:23.416
Oh, yeah.

01:09:23.791 --> 01:09:26.500
We went out last Wednesday.
It's already been a week…

01:09:27.166 --> 01:09:29.291
but it feels like a month.

01:09:29.791 --> 01:09:33.625
Last time, it wasn't easy
to convince Pradeep with my lies.

01:09:35.041 --> 01:09:39.166
<i>Hey, Pradeep,</i>
<i>I can't attend your call today.</i>

01:09:39.416 --> 01:09:41.958
My cousin and family are coming
from our native place to visit us.

01:09:42.041 --> 01:09:45.416
My dad is pestering me
to show them around.

01:09:46.208 --> 01:09:48.375
It's okay, baby. Carry on.

01:09:49.166 --> 01:09:50.583
It's so annoying, baby.

01:09:50.666 --> 01:09:53.750
It's my weekly off,
and I wanted to spend time with you.

01:09:53.833 --> 01:09:57.375
Dad is irritating me asking me
to show them all around the city.

01:09:57.458 --> 01:10:00.208
Just for a day, right, baby?
Just bear it and show them around.

01:10:00.291 --> 01:10:04.583
<i>Just for a day, right, baby?</i>

01:10:05.166 --> 01:10:06.666
<i>Just bear it and show them around</i>

01:10:06.750 --> 01:10:10.916
<i>Just for a day, right, baby?</i>

01:10:11.416 --> 01:10:13.291
<i>Just bear it and show them around</i>

01:10:14.625 --> 01:10:15.750
So, how did it go?

01:10:15.833 --> 01:10:17.166
Yeah, it was good, baby.

01:10:17.375 --> 01:10:19.083
We went to the mall and the beach.

01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:22.708
My cousin's kids were all over me.

01:10:23.041 --> 01:10:28.458
<i>My cousin's wife said that their kids</i>
<i>have never been so friendly with anyone.</i>

01:10:28.916 --> 01:10:31.625
Obviously.
How can anyone not like my girl?

01:10:33.791 --> 01:10:34.666
Hey!

01:10:35.416 --> 01:10:37.583
What's with that freakish laughter?

01:10:37.958 --> 01:10:40.125
I just realized how big a fool I am!

01:10:40.208 --> 01:10:43.166
You carry on. I'll deal with it.

01:10:44.541 --> 01:10:46.666
This is what happens when you're
on the phone all the time.

01:10:46.750 --> 01:10:48.750
Now, get up and get ready!

01:10:49.125 --> 01:10:51.375
God! What will the groom's family think!

01:11:04.750 --> 01:11:06.750
What will I tell him?

01:11:06.875 --> 01:11:10.041
He'll believe any lie you tell him anyway.
Just give him some excuse and come.

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:12.625
And yes, hope you remember what I said.

01:11:12.958 --> 01:11:14.875
All I want is your happiness.

01:11:15.250 --> 01:11:17.333
Of late, you seem like you've changed.

01:11:17.916 --> 01:11:19.541
Nikitha I knew was so positive.

01:11:19.625 --> 01:11:21.958
You used to light up every place
you set foot on.

01:11:22.625 --> 01:11:25.166
You've become negative since
you started going out with Pradeep.

01:11:25.416 --> 01:11:28.333
Yeah, true. I also feel the same way.

01:11:28.916 --> 01:11:32.541
He keeps controlling me,
and I have to lie to him to do things.

01:11:33.375 --> 01:11:35.125
I want my old baby girl back.

01:11:35.666 --> 01:11:36.541
Okay.

01:11:36.875 --> 01:11:42.708
Remember we carved our names on a tree
in Semmozhi Garden? It's still there!

01:11:43.166 --> 01:11:44.583
Just like it's etched in my heart.

01:11:44.666 --> 01:11:46.541
Come on, please forget me.

01:11:46.625 --> 01:11:47.916
Instead, you could've asked me to die.

01:11:48.333 --> 01:11:49.250
-Then die!
-Nikitha…

01:11:49.791 --> 01:11:51.875
I know I'm going a bit overboard…

01:11:52.208 --> 01:11:53.500
but still, I want to ask you.

01:11:54.375 --> 01:11:56.083
If you get married to Pradeep…

01:11:58.500 --> 01:11:59.500
will you still…

01:12:01.083 --> 01:12:02.166
be friends with me?

01:12:03.041 --> 01:12:05.208
Definitely, dear. Promise.

01:12:06.083 --> 01:12:07.041
Baby girl…

01:12:08.625 --> 01:12:09.708
<i>I…</i>

01:12:10.791 --> 01:12:11.750
<i>miss you.</i>

01:12:12.083 --> 01:12:15.083
<i>Oh, really? Didn't you realize</i>
<i>that when you broke up with me?</i>

01:12:15.416 --> 01:12:18.000
<i>Anyway, I've put Pradeep's call</i>
<i>on hold for a long time. Bye.</i>

01:12:21.708 --> 01:12:23.583
Baby girl, did you listen to it?

01:12:24.041 --> 01:12:26.583
<i>The day we went on a long</i>
<i>drive was awesome, right?</i>

01:12:27.041 --> 01:12:28.833
It was an awesome night, not a day.

01:12:40.166 --> 01:12:41.000
Hello.

01:12:41.458 --> 01:12:47.291
<i>Oh, baby, without you by my side</i>
<i>And with all the loneliness around me</i>

01:12:47.791 --> 01:12:52.041
<i>I am suffering here all by myself</i>

01:12:52.125 --> 01:12:53.500
Now, what?

01:12:53.958 --> 01:12:59.666
<i>Don't leave me, my dear Mamakutty</i>

01:12:59.916 --> 01:13:01.375
Can you stop singing?

01:13:01.666 --> 01:13:05.708
Guess what's more horrible than
my singing! His name, Mamakutty!

01:13:05.958 --> 01:13:08.041
<i>He's your ex, isn't he?</i>

01:13:08.458 --> 01:13:11.583
The way he calls you baby girl
and you call him Mamakutty…

01:13:11.666 --> 01:13:12.541
wow!

01:13:12.875 --> 01:13:15.125
That was all just for fun.

01:13:15.208 --> 01:13:18.583
You want to have fun at the expense
of the lives of guys like us?!

01:13:19.083 --> 01:13:24.750
Why do you add four Ys to Mamakutty?
Why the stress on Y?

01:13:24.833 --> 01:13:27.666
I mean, does he even look like a baby?
He looks like a pregnant wild boar!

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.625
Why are you bringing up his topic?
That's my past!

01:13:30.708 --> 01:13:33.916
"That's my past!" It'd sound
right if the past remained past!

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.166
-Why is he in your present life?
-I don't have any feelings for him.

01:13:37.250 --> 01:13:41.000
Is that why you've saved his contact
name as the nickname you gave him?

01:13:41.083 --> 01:13:45.208
I don't even think about him
to change his contact name.

01:13:47.666 --> 01:13:48.666
So, you don't think about him?

01:13:48.750 --> 01:13:49.833
Not at all.

01:13:50.291 --> 01:13:52.166
You don't even think about him
to rename his contact.

01:13:52.250 --> 01:13:53.291
I don't!

01:13:55.708 --> 01:13:57.708
-You don't?
-I don't!

01:13:58.125 --> 01:13:58.958
You don't?

01:13:59.333 --> 01:14:00.291
No, I don't!

01:14:01.166 --> 01:14:03.416
Nikitha, don't lie!

01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:06.250
Don't lie blatantly!
You went on a long drive with him!

01:14:10.375 --> 01:14:11.291
Hey…

01:14:12.083 --> 01:14:13.250
he called me out of the blue

01:14:14.250 --> 01:14:17.166
<i>and said he was depressed.</i>
<i>He asked me to go with him.</i>

01:14:17.875 --> 01:14:20.333
<i>He was always there to support</i>
<i>me during tough times.</i>

01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:22.208
<i>I didn't know what to do.</i>

01:14:24.125 --> 01:14:25.916
<i>So, I went out with him just as friends.</i>

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.333
<i>We sang Sid Sriram's songs</i>
<i>throughout the drive.</i>

01:14:30.166 --> 01:14:33.708
<i>Suddenly, your face flashed</i>
<i>in front of my eyes.</i>

01:14:34.416 --> 01:14:36.166
<i>At that moment, I felt guilty.</i>

01:14:36.750 --> 01:14:38.541
I asked him to turn
around the car at once.

01:14:39.416 --> 01:14:41.125
We had reached Kalpakkam,

01:14:41.625 --> 01:14:43.708
so he persuaded me to go to Pondy
and watch the sunrise.

01:14:44.541 --> 01:14:45.541
It made sense.

01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:48.583
So, we went there to watch
the sunrise and came back.

01:14:50.875 --> 01:14:52.125
Nothing else happened.

01:14:55.125 --> 01:14:56.125
-Hello?
<i>-Come again!</i>

01:14:56.666 --> 01:14:59.958
You guys reached Kalpakkam,
and he persuaded you to go to Pondy?!

01:15:00.333 --> 01:15:02.958
Didn't he ask if you wanted
to check into a lodge in Pondy?

01:15:03.041 --> 01:15:05.500
Shut up! We just went for a drive
and returned home!

01:15:05.708 --> 01:15:06.666
Nothing else happened!

01:15:07.083 --> 01:15:10.625
Nikitha, even your cousin's
kids won't believe this story.

01:15:11.041 --> 01:15:14.250
You're saying you went on a night drive
to Pondicherry with your ex…

01:15:14.875 --> 01:15:16.250
<i>and yet nothing happened!</i>

01:15:16.708 --> 01:15:19.541
Come on, go ahead. Lie. Keep lying.

01:15:19.625 --> 01:15:22.791
-I could've hidden everything, but--
-Keep lying!

01:15:22.875 --> 01:15:24.833
-I could've said I didn't go at all.
-Keep lying!

01:15:24.916 --> 01:15:26.291
-Keep lying!
<i>-Why should I even tell you all this?</i>

01:15:26.375 --> 01:15:28.208
Because you know I saw
all the messages already!

01:15:29.250 --> 01:15:32.500
I couldn't make out if you were
telling me the truth or not!

01:15:34.041 --> 01:15:36.166
I just have one question.

01:15:36.666 --> 01:15:39.458
With me, will it be your first time,
or have you already…

01:15:43.333 --> 01:15:44.916
Pradeep, I'm telling you,

01:15:45.458 --> 01:15:47.333
don't ask me such filthy questions!

01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:50.208
Even if you've done it,
it's not a big deal, Nikitha.

01:15:50.583 --> 01:15:54.375
But refusing it after doing
it is what makes me furious!

01:15:57.083 --> 01:15:59.166
How can I accept it if I haven't done it?

01:15:59.875 --> 01:16:05.208
You were together for six hours,
and he didn't even touch you?!

01:16:06.541 --> 01:16:09.666
Like, a hug while bidding goodbye…

01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:14.291
or shaking hands,
or something while changing the gear!

01:16:16.208 --> 01:16:19.375
I promise nothing happened!

01:16:19.791 --> 01:16:21.875
"I promise nothing happened!"
Oh, shut up!

01:16:22.125 --> 01:16:23.375
Talk properly!

01:16:26.208 --> 01:16:29.291
Before, I was proud of the fact
that you were in love with me.

01:16:29.458 --> 01:16:31.833
I'd show off to others that
Nikitha is my girlfriend.

01:16:32.541 --> 01:16:37.708
Now, after seeing your ex,
I doubt your taste in men.

01:16:39.333 --> 01:16:42.375
You're talking to your ex behind my back.

01:16:43.083 --> 01:16:45.458
Now, that makes me doubt myself.

01:16:45.541 --> 01:16:48.500
I'm developing an inferiority complex,
like, am I so ugly?

01:16:51.541 --> 01:16:52.833
Okay, Nikitha.

01:16:54.583 --> 01:16:55.416
I'll do one thing.

01:16:56.291 --> 01:17:00.166
I shall also go
on a long drive with my ex.

01:17:00.250 --> 01:17:03.000
A long drive to Pondicherry
to watch the sunset.

01:17:03.083 --> 01:17:04.708
But we won't do anything like you did.

01:17:10.791 --> 01:17:12.791
Hey, stop acting!

01:17:24.958 --> 01:17:26.708
What a smart groom, right?

01:17:52.250 --> 01:17:54.791
Looks like your younger
brother has a girlfriend.

01:17:54.916 --> 01:17:55.916
Ask them to elope.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.500
Won't you confront him?

01:17:57.708 --> 01:17:59.875
If I confront him,
he'll confront me back!

01:18:00.333 --> 01:18:02.208
Others must stay within their
limits themselves

01:18:02.291 --> 01:18:03.875
if they expect us
to stay within our limits.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.750
Hold on. Where are you going?
You can stay here.

01:18:08.916 --> 01:18:10.666
What if you guys want some privacy?

01:18:11.208 --> 01:18:12.166
Go ahead.

01:18:18.125 --> 01:18:19.166
You'll realize it if it happens to you.

01:18:48.208 --> 01:18:49.166
DAD
INCOMING VOICE CALL

01:18:57.500 --> 01:18:58.500
So, tell me.

01:18:59.166 --> 01:19:00.958
WhatsApp, Facebook, Insta, Twitter,

01:19:01.041 --> 01:19:03.625
Tinder, Telegram, Hike,
Messenger, Gmail, Gpay,

01:19:03.708 --> 01:19:05.666
Paytm, SMS, Snapchat, Tantan…

01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:09.208
there are so many such apps.
It takes one day to dig into a single app,

01:19:09.291 --> 01:19:11.291
and your daughter has
all these apps installed.

01:19:13.166 --> 01:19:15.250
Apart from this, there is her friend,
best friend, boyfriend,

01:19:15.333 --> 01:19:17.541
ex-boyfriend, school mate,
college mate, office mate,

01:19:17.625 --> 01:19:19.666
tuition mate, bus mate,
gym mate, dance mate,

01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:22.250
and Suresh, who's unique
because he's her shuttle mate.

01:19:22.750 --> 01:19:25.500
I don't have any problem if she
has a mate to play badminton with.

01:19:25.583 --> 01:19:28.250
The problem is that I just got to know
she goes to play badminton.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.416
We have to do a thorough check, right?

01:19:33.041 --> 01:19:34.333
-Yes.
-Ask me why.

01:19:34.875 --> 01:19:36.583
-Why?
-Or else, we'll slip.

01:19:43.750 --> 01:19:45.583
-We must do a thorough check.
-Yes.

01:19:45.666 --> 01:19:46.708
A thorough check!

01:19:47.291 --> 01:19:48.208
Yes!

01:19:48.291 --> 01:19:49.250
Must check!

01:19:50.208 --> 01:19:51.166
Yes!

01:19:51.750 --> 01:19:52.708
Must…

01:19:55.791 --> 01:19:56.666
I shall do it.

01:19:57.625 --> 01:19:59.583
That alliance is expected
after four days, right?

01:19:59.875 --> 01:20:02.166
I'll keep your daughter's
mobile for three more days.

01:20:03.708 --> 01:20:04.583
So--

01:20:05.333 --> 01:20:06.333
She can keep my phone.

01:20:07.833 --> 01:20:09.500
Nikitha, come inside.

01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:12.625
Hey!

01:20:13.791 --> 01:20:14.875
You missed that spot.

01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:22.375
Dad, his phone is clean.

01:20:22.958 --> 01:20:24.291
He is clean.

01:20:24.375 --> 01:20:25.666
Bullshit! Give me!

01:20:29.458 --> 01:20:31.416
Yes, Venkatapathy, how do
you like your new home?

01:20:37.416 --> 01:20:38.291
Rascal!

01:20:41.583 --> 01:20:43.833
I guess the rascal deleted everything.

01:20:45.583 --> 01:20:46.708
Now, what we'll do is…

01:20:46.875 --> 01:20:50.291
we'll uninstall and reinstall
WhatsApp on his phone.

01:20:50.875 --> 01:20:54.000
While reinstalling, it'll ask us
if we want to restore the backup.

01:20:54.416 --> 01:20:56.916
Poor app! When it asks us,
we must oblige and restore the backup!

01:20:58.625 --> 01:21:00.916
All the messages he deleted will reappear.

01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:08.750
Shweta, the dog stepped out of the room.

01:21:09.583 --> 01:21:11.500
Tie it properly. I mean, the dog.

01:21:45.333 --> 01:21:46.250
Sit.

01:21:50.750 --> 01:21:52.833
Three days, right?

01:21:53.708 --> 01:21:54.541
Yes.

01:21:54.625 --> 01:21:56.208
Nikitha completely agrees with this.

01:21:58.333 --> 01:21:59.541
Ask me why.

01:22:02.291 --> 01:22:03.166
How come?

01:22:04.166 --> 01:22:09.000
Uthaman Pradeep,
your true colors will now be exposed.

01:22:38.958 --> 01:22:40.916
Pradeep, even I want to swap
my phone with my groom.

01:22:41.208 --> 01:22:42.416
Or else, I don't want this marriage.

01:22:43.833 --> 01:22:44.708
Yes!

01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:06.333
Dude!

01:23:07.375 --> 01:23:08.583
-Dude.
-Yeah, bro?

01:23:08.958 --> 01:23:13.458
Can you hack a phone
and delete all the data in it?

01:23:14.666 --> 01:23:15.583
Very simple.

01:23:15.708 --> 01:23:17.666
I'll send a link to that phone.

01:23:20.458 --> 01:23:21.708
And if they click on it…

01:23:24.125 --> 01:23:25.166
I'll hack it.

01:23:25.250 --> 01:23:26.833
Do it! Come on!

01:23:29.375 --> 01:23:31.083
By the way,
whose phone do you want to hack?

01:23:32.083 --> 01:23:32.958
My phone.

01:23:33.208 --> 01:23:34.083
Trapped!

01:23:43.791 --> 01:23:44.666
Hi.

01:23:44.791 --> 01:23:47.458
You gave me your number on Facebook,
you gave me your number on Twitter,

01:23:47.666 --> 01:23:50.416
on Insta, and on TikTok. Your Snapchat
photo-- You gave me your number on OLX.

01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:52.583
So, you're what they call
"breathtaking beauty."

01:23:52.666 --> 01:23:53.916
I'm going to make a short film…

01:23:54.250 --> 01:23:55.958
and I'm looking for
a beautiful girl like you…

01:23:57.208 --> 01:23:58.208
to cast in it.

01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:01.333
If you don't mind,
can you send me your photos on WhatsApp?

01:24:01.583 --> 01:24:05.083
Like, in every attire, Western,
traditional, casual, and…

01:24:05.333 --> 01:24:06.208
tribal!

01:24:07.083 --> 01:24:08.458
Only if you don't mind, okay?

01:24:08.583 --> 01:24:09.625
-Oh.
-Thanks.

01:24:09.875 --> 01:24:10.791
-Sure.
-Okay.

01:24:10.916 --> 01:24:11.750
-No, I won't.
-Disgusting!

01:24:11.875 --> 01:24:14.291
-Sorry, not interested.
-Sorry, my parents won't allow me.

01:24:14.416 --> 01:24:16.333
It's okay. Fine.

01:24:16.583 --> 01:24:17.500
Love you.

01:24:27.250 --> 01:24:29.291
-Hey…
-Grandma, get me another banana.

01:24:29.375 --> 01:24:32.291
You've had a dozen bananas since morning.
Act like the groom.

01:24:45.666 --> 01:24:46.500
Hello.

01:24:48.583 --> 01:24:49.416
What is it?

01:24:49.625 --> 01:24:50.458
She said hello.

01:24:55.083 --> 01:24:56.458
You tell me, why did I spit on your face?

01:24:56.750 --> 01:24:59.625
<i>Whose chat did she read,</i>
<i>Bhuvana's or Sophie's?</i>

01:24:59.750 --> 01:25:02.500
<i>Sophie's chat would have</i>
<i>earned me a good bashing.</i>

01:25:02.833 --> 01:25:03.833
<i>Definitely Bhuvana's.</i>

01:25:03.916 --> 01:25:05.166
I also feel the same.

01:25:08.625 --> 01:25:09.666
Tell me!

01:25:11.458 --> 01:25:12.291
Bhuvana?

01:25:12.375 --> 01:25:13.583
Now, who's Bhuvana?

01:25:14.375 --> 01:25:16.625
Hello!

01:25:17.666 --> 01:25:19.416
Answer me! Hello!

01:25:19.875 --> 01:25:21.208
Hello!

01:25:21.375 --> 01:25:23.666
Hello. Sorry, I couldn't hear you earlier.
Tell me now.

01:25:24.291 --> 01:25:26.916
I haven't read that yet.
This is different.

01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:29.083
-Come on, guess.
-No. You tell me.

01:25:29.708 --> 01:25:31.875
-It's okay. Make a guess.
-Nikitha, come on. Say it.

01:25:32.625 --> 01:25:34.291
-Are you going to make a short film?
-No.

01:25:34.375 --> 01:25:36.500
You've collected photos from
girls saying that you are.

01:25:36.583 --> 01:25:37.583
Aren't you ashamed?

01:25:38.125 --> 01:25:41.041
Oh, about that… my friends were
planning to make a short film--

01:25:42.625 --> 01:25:43.458
Hey, what--

01:25:43.791 --> 01:25:45.708
My friends were planning
to make a short film.

01:25:46.125 --> 01:25:48.291
So, I helped them with casting.
A social service.

01:25:49.375 --> 01:25:50.916
Why do you need their
photos in tribal attire?

01:25:51.125 --> 01:25:52.958
-For a variety.
-Variety?

01:25:53.083 --> 01:25:53.916
Yes.

01:25:54.541 --> 01:25:55.833
Wait, you're getting a call.

01:25:57.291 --> 01:25:58.166
Hello.

01:25:58.916 --> 01:25:59.750
Yes, tell me.

01:25:59.833 --> 01:26:02.833
Ma'am, I'm calling from ICICO Bank.
Do you need a loan?

01:26:03.458 --> 01:26:06.291
-No, thanks.
-Ma'am, please! Hold on!

01:26:06.625 --> 01:26:07.791
Can I talk to Pradeep sir?

01:26:08.750 --> 01:26:09.583
Why?

01:26:09.666 --> 01:26:13.208
Even if he refuses a loan, he'll at least
talk to me for a while to console me.

01:26:13.375 --> 01:26:14.791
<i>You're just hanging up right away!</i>

01:26:15.625 --> 01:26:17.250
Oh, I see.

01:26:17.791 --> 01:26:20.458
Wait, I'll put him on a conference call.

01:26:24.833 --> 01:26:26.041
Who was it?

01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:28.791
Hello, sir! It's me ICICO Lavanya!
How are you?

01:26:28.875 --> 01:26:31.291
Lavanya, I'm good! How have you been?

01:26:31.833 --> 01:26:34.208
Well, I've been better, sir.
Nobody wants to take out a loan.

01:26:34.416 --> 01:26:37.791
Don't lose hope. Good things will
happen to kindhearted people like you.

01:26:38.291 --> 01:26:41.708
Madam, I told you he'd console me, right?

01:26:42.583 --> 01:26:44.791
You'd gone to Singapore to make
a short film, right? When did you return?

01:26:44.875 --> 01:26:46.333
-Singapore?!
-Yes, madam.

01:26:46.541 --> 01:26:48.875
He has promised me
a chance in his next movie.

01:26:50.375 --> 01:26:52.750
-Oh, really?
-Yes, madam.

01:26:52.958 --> 01:26:55.666
Sir, I have even sent you
my photos in tribal attire.

01:26:55.750 --> 01:26:57.208
<i>I hope you'll give me a chance.</i>

01:26:58.666 --> 01:27:01.291
Sir, she's asking you.
Hope you'll give her a chance.

01:27:02.666 --> 01:27:06.291
Lavanya, call me after three days.

01:27:07.333 --> 01:27:09.500
-We'll talk then.
-Okay, sir.

01:27:09.750 --> 01:27:12.958
Madam, I'd told you,
he is very kindhearted.

01:27:13.041 --> 01:27:14.000
True!

01:27:14.208 --> 01:27:17.166
Okay, madam. If you need a loan,
then give me a missed call on this number.

01:27:17.250 --> 01:27:18.083
Thank you.

01:27:26.958 --> 01:27:27.791
Hello?

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:33.083
She said hello again, right?

01:27:36.958 --> 01:27:38.958
You're going to make a short film?!

01:27:39.291 --> 01:27:42.250
You can't even click a proper picture
for your profile! Short film, my foot!

01:27:42.708 --> 01:27:46.833
Nikitha, I'm going to make a short film
called "App Lock" based on our life story.

01:27:47.208 --> 01:27:49.333
After its success, I'll make a movie
with Jayam Ravi called "Joker!"

01:27:50.125 --> 01:27:51.625
You are a joker!

01:27:51.791 --> 01:27:53.333
You want to cast Jayam Revi?! My foot!

01:27:53.416 --> 01:27:58.208
-You joker!
-It's Jayam Ravi, not Revi! Got it?

01:27:58.291 --> 01:28:00.500
I'll succeed one day,
and you will witness it!

01:28:00.666 --> 01:28:02.125
First, let me check who Bhuvana is!

01:28:02.208 --> 01:28:06.000
-You'll regret it! You will!
-You listen to me!

01:28:06.083 --> 01:28:09.083
Aren't you ashamed to chat
with girls like that?

01:28:14.291 --> 01:28:15.125
Dude…

01:28:15.666 --> 01:28:16.875
any update from the hacker?

01:28:17.416 --> 01:28:18.250
If they click on it…

01:28:19.291 --> 01:28:20.166
I'll hack it!

01:28:22.750 --> 01:28:23.958
I was living like a king!

01:28:24.375 --> 01:28:25.208
Forget it, dude.

01:28:25.416 --> 01:28:27.125
-A smoke will make you feel better.
-I also want it.

01:28:27.458 --> 01:28:28.916
-Which brand?
-Your sister smokes?!

01:28:29.916 --> 01:28:32.041
I also want to swap phones
with him like you did.

01:28:32.291 --> 01:28:34.000
Are you nuts?

01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:36.500
-You shouldn't peep into others' phones.
-Why?

01:28:36.708 --> 01:28:38.083
Your wedding will be called off.
Please, no.

01:28:38.250 --> 01:28:40.166
If he's clean,
then why can't he give the phone?

01:28:40.250 --> 01:28:41.333
Because that's where all the dirt is.

01:28:41.833 --> 01:28:43.750
The day after tomorrow is your wedding.

01:28:43.958 --> 01:28:47.458
Will you be okay with it if
I marry the wrong person?

01:28:47.541 --> 01:28:48.958
This is what Nikitha's dad
would've also thought.

01:28:49.041 --> 01:28:50.333
Isn't it? No.

01:28:53.625 --> 01:28:54.625
Did you ask him?

01:28:56.208 --> 01:29:00.666
My friend Thooriga
and her fiancé swapped their phones.

01:29:01.166 --> 01:29:02.500
"What a shame!

01:29:03.833 --> 01:29:05.208
It's bad manners.

01:29:06.416 --> 01:29:07.791
It sounds childish.

01:29:09.208 --> 01:29:10.458
It's driving me crazy.

01:29:11.666 --> 01:29:13.666
What are you up to?
It doesn't seem right."

01:29:14.666 --> 01:29:18.041
So, he cleverly ignored that topic.

01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:19.333
Yeah.

01:29:19.833 --> 01:29:21.416
-What an idea!
-You're right!

01:29:22.250 --> 01:29:25.333
If you do it again,
the groom might create a scene.

01:29:25.583 --> 01:29:27.875
Forget it. I'd told you to check
all this eight months ago.

01:29:27.958 --> 01:29:29.791
Back then, you tricked me into
eating sweets that had gone bad,

01:29:29.875 --> 01:29:31.041
and now you're regretting it?!

01:29:31.916 --> 01:29:35.250
The groom will create a scene only if
you ask him to swap phones, right?

01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:38.083
What if we make him
give his phone to you?

01:29:43.375 --> 01:29:44.875
We'll ask for his mobile to click selfies.

01:29:45.083 --> 01:29:47.333
-Use your phone.
-My phone's camera sucks.

01:29:47.666 --> 01:29:50.000
-Come on, take it out.
-Someone, please take a photo.

01:29:50.083 --> 01:29:51.375
-I'll do it.
-I'll finish you off!

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.375
Why is your hand trembling?

01:29:55.875 --> 01:29:57.000
Show me the photo.

01:29:58.875 --> 01:30:00.541
-Give it to me.
-I'll WhatsApp it to you.

01:30:01.541 --> 01:30:03.291
-Next…
-I wish to go on a bike ride

01:30:03.375 --> 01:30:05.875
-with him before getting married.
-What kind of a wish is that?

01:30:06.208 --> 01:30:09.375
Let her go, it's her wish. Okay, we'll
go in the car. You guys come on a bike.

01:30:09.791 --> 01:30:10.625
Bye, Mr. Groom!

01:30:11.125 --> 01:30:12.625
Are you on Tinder?

01:30:14.208 --> 01:30:15.291
You smoke a joint?!

01:30:15.916 --> 01:30:18.208
You're living the life!
Hope you'll party tonight!

01:30:19.750 --> 01:30:21.875
"You look tasty, like sweet made of milk.

01:30:21.958 --> 01:30:24.458
I'm going to eat you
like Dairy Milk Silk."

01:30:24.541 --> 01:30:26.041
You've sent the same poem to everyone!

01:30:26.250 --> 01:30:27.708
Ask for his phone to use the map.

01:30:27.916 --> 01:30:29.375
-Use the map.
-You do it.

01:30:29.458 --> 01:30:31.500
-My phone doesn't have internet.
-I'll turn on my hotspot.

01:30:31.583 --> 01:30:34.125
-My phone is about to die.
-Then throw that useless phone away.

01:30:34.208 --> 01:30:36.041
Kaalikaatha Kali Amman Temple.

01:30:36.125 --> 01:30:37.958
I'll hold it,
or you won't be able to drive.

01:30:38.041 --> 01:30:40.083
-No, thanks.
-How will you apply the clutch?

01:30:40.166 --> 01:30:41.250
Watch me! Like this!

01:30:42.291 --> 01:30:44.958
Why have you hidden your status from me?
Whom do you post status for?

01:30:47.458 --> 01:30:49.833
Hey, Pulthish! No! Wait! Stop!

01:30:50.750 --> 01:30:52.791
Water. Pradeep, get me some water.

01:30:52.875 --> 01:30:55.375
-Pulthish! Yogi, please save him!
-Mummy!

01:30:58.041 --> 01:30:59.166
-That way!
-Here.

01:31:00.166 --> 01:31:01.375
Quick! Jump in and save him!

01:31:10.708 --> 01:31:12.791
Bullshit! You've got
a pathetic family!

01:31:12.958 --> 01:31:15.458
Who gave you permission to save him?
Can't you wait for me?

01:31:15.875 --> 01:31:17.125
Can't you be a little patient?

01:31:17.583 --> 01:31:19.625
-Damn it!
-Talk him into giving his phone.

01:31:19.958 --> 01:31:22.250
My husband doesn't keep secrets from me.

01:31:22.375 --> 01:31:24.333
I even know his phone's password.

01:31:24.666 --> 01:31:25.750
Do you want to check my phone?

01:31:26.166 --> 01:31:28.291
<i>What kind of kiss do you like</i>

01:31:28.833 --> 01:31:31.291
<i>-Or how about a French kiss?</i>
-Thanks.

01:31:32.416 --> 01:31:33.291
Let's go.

01:31:33.708 --> 01:31:35.250
I don't keep secrets from my wife.

01:31:36.541 --> 01:31:37.666
Except for this secret phone.

01:31:37.750 --> 01:31:38.958
Boomer Uncle!

01:31:39.375 --> 01:31:40.791
Flick it while he is sleeping.

01:31:45.791 --> 01:31:46.666
Yes!

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.583
Do you talk to him because
you fought with me,

01:32:05.666 --> 01:32:07.708
or do you fight with me so
that you can talk to him?

01:32:07.791 --> 01:32:09.666
-I didn't get it.
-I just don't get it.

01:32:09.791 --> 01:32:12.083
What is it that you don't get, dear?

01:32:12.416 --> 01:32:13.583
<i>Damn, he's a goner</i>

01:32:13.916 --> 01:32:20.666
<i>So, how good do you feel now?</i>

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:27.333
<i>So, how good do you feel now?</i>

01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:28.750
You're living the life!

01:32:30.958 --> 01:32:31.833
Thank you.

01:32:32.791 --> 01:32:36.083
This morning, I met Ramesh.
In the afternoon, I met Suresh.

01:32:36.750 --> 01:32:38.500
If I tell this to Pradeep,
he'll yell at me.

01:32:39.958 --> 01:32:41.916
One of the best days of my life.

01:32:42.791 --> 01:32:45.000
If I don't like something,
you won't stop doing it, right?

01:32:45.083 --> 01:32:46.666
Instead, you'll find a way
to do it behind my back, right?

01:32:47.916 --> 01:32:48.791
Welcome!

01:32:49.375 --> 01:32:51.041
Uthama, you're living the life!

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.166
You've got a message from OYO
saying, "We miss you, Pradeep."

01:32:55.250 --> 01:32:57.291
Nikki, we friends booked
a room in OYO to booze.

01:32:57.375 --> 01:32:58.500
Tell me your Vault password.

01:32:58.625 --> 01:33:00.416
Vault? There is no need for that.

01:33:00.666 --> 01:33:02.500
-I need it.
-Please, no.

01:33:02.583 --> 01:33:03.583
I need it, tell me!

01:33:03.875 --> 01:33:05.166
250595.

01:33:05.250 --> 01:33:06.666
That's Sophie's date of birth, right?

01:33:06.750 --> 01:33:07.916
That's my bike number!

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:12.000
My photos?!

01:33:12.166 --> 01:33:13.500
<i>He's a goner</i>

01:33:16.291 --> 01:33:18.791
<i>You told me you deleted those photos.</i>
<i>Why do you still have them?</i>

01:33:18.875 --> 01:33:21.000
For the same reason I asked
for them in the first place.

01:33:21.750 --> 01:33:25.458
HENNA CEREMONY

01:33:25.916 --> 01:33:27.041
I need to make a call.
Can I have your phone--

01:33:27.125 --> 01:33:28.625
No! Get lost!

01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:37.125
Mani, I had called Pradeep
to ask for a hooker's number…

01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:39.500
but he disconnected the call
without saying a word.

01:33:39.708 --> 01:33:41.500
Why did you call him?

01:33:41.875 --> 01:33:43.583
I know he won't have any numbers,

01:33:43.666 --> 01:33:45.458
but I just gave it a shot.

01:33:53.916 --> 01:33:55.083
Damn it! Get lost!

01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:04.333
Nikitha…

01:34:05.083 --> 01:34:07.083
I'd called you yesterday.
A guy answered the call and…

01:34:07.166 --> 01:34:08.750
-And?
-He abused me.

01:34:10.166 --> 01:34:11.166
Well, I'm used to it.

01:34:11.666 --> 01:34:15.250
He refused to approve my leave. I stared
at him angrily and put him in his place.

01:34:15.333 --> 01:34:17.583
Only after I put him in his place--

01:34:18.083 --> 01:34:18.958
Sorry.

01:34:22.541 --> 01:34:23.500
What's going on?

01:34:23.583 --> 01:34:24.708
What? Nothing!

01:34:25.208 --> 01:34:27.375
-What's going on?
-Dude, forget it.

01:34:27.916 --> 01:34:29.291
Dude, tell us, what's going on?

01:34:42.333 --> 01:34:43.666
<i>Why are you online?</i>

01:34:46.041 --> 01:34:47.458
<i>Why are you online?</i>

01:34:48.541 --> 01:34:51.375
<i>I'm online to check if you are online.</i>

01:34:52.166 --> 01:34:53.083
<i>Same here.</i>

01:35:02.083 --> 01:35:06.791
Dude, "Mood Mahesh typing"
in "The Gates of Heaven" WhatsApp group!

01:35:12.583 --> 01:35:17.000
Call him and ask him
not to send any message!

01:35:25.083 --> 01:35:26.125
He already sent a message.

01:35:27.791 --> 01:35:29.083
"The Gates of Heaven!"

01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:30.708
What story did he post?

01:35:31.541 --> 01:35:32.458
<i>Title…</i>

01:35:32.625 --> 01:35:34.166
<i>"Will you ditch your husband for me?"</i>

01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:37.625
"I had been to Aunt Veena's
house during my summer vacation."

01:35:38.250 --> 01:35:40.708
She had a useless husband.

01:35:40.958 --> 01:35:44.958
Auntie was afraid of geckos,
so she kept the door open while bathing.

01:35:45.333 --> 01:35:46.708
"I made a smooth move and--"

01:35:49.958 --> 01:35:51.708
Dude, we must set the roof on fire.

01:35:51.833 --> 01:35:53.125
Yes, we must.

01:35:53.541 --> 01:35:56.416
-Nice and slow…
-We must put up a good show.

01:35:56.833 --> 01:35:58.250
Dude, I want to rock her world.

01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:02.291
At least once in this lifetime,
I must ride downtown with her.

01:36:04.333 --> 01:36:05.166
A ride downtown!

01:36:06.458 --> 01:36:09.250
-Downtown…
-Yes.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.708
<i>And I'll point at you</i>

01:36:17.291 --> 01:36:19.083
To hell with that doofus!

01:36:25.791 --> 01:36:26.708
Pradeep…

01:36:27.333 --> 01:36:28.833
what do you mean by "a ride downtown"?

01:36:31.333 --> 01:36:35.583
A ride downtown obviously means
a ride to the downtown area, doesn't it?

01:36:35.791 --> 01:36:37.625
What do you mean by "I want to ride
downtown with Samanna"?

01:36:38.166 --> 01:36:40.666
She's a heroine,
and that's just a fantasy.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:42.875
Oh!

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:47.041
So, if I say, I want to ride
downtown with Sarath Kumar…

01:36:47.541 --> 01:36:48.666
will you be okay with it?

01:36:49.083 --> 01:36:51.125
You will ride downtown
with Sarath Kumar?!

01:36:57.583 --> 01:36:59.625
I just went through your browser history.

01:37:00.291 --> 01:37:04.583
"Namitha naval hot, Tamanna thighs
hot, Anushka leaked video hot!"

01:37:05.291 --> 01:37:06.833
Are you such a hardcore pervert?

01:37:07.208 --> 01:37:08.541
What?!

01:37:08.791 --> 01:37:09.708
Hey!

01:37:10.166 --> 01:37:12.416
-Hi, Ma.
-Fine. Continue.

01:37:14.541 --> 01:37:15.958
Hardcore pervert?!

01:37:16.333 --> 01:37:17.875
Have I ever misbehaved with you?

01:37:18.958 --> 01:37:19.791
No.

01:37:20.666 --> 01:37:22.833
Don't you call me a gentleman?

01:37:23.458 --> 01:37:24.291
Yes.

01:37:24.375 --> 01:37:25.333
Why do you think that is?

01:37:25.791 --> 01:37:28.000
I used to watch all that
before coming to see you.

01:37:29.250 --> 01:37:31.916
But why did you watch all that
before coming to see my dad?

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:33.208
You browser history shows it all!

01:37:33.333 --> 01:37:36.666
Hey, let go of the phone! Let go!

01:37:37.750 --> 01:37:40.875
Let go of the phone! I said, let go!

01:37:43.458 --> 01:37:45.125
Now, that was one new trick!

01:37:46.500 --> 01:37:47.375
Dude…

01:37:47.708 --> 01:37:49.041
any update from the hacker?

01:37:49.750 --> 01:37:50.666
If they click on it…

01:37:51.333 --> 01:37:52.416
I'll hack it.

01:37:56.625 --> 01:37:57.458
Nikitha?!

01:37:58.250 --> 01:38:00.416
Do you think we'll believe this?

01:38:00.791 --> 01:38:04.458
We must be fools to believe you when you
say, "I watched porn but did nothing."

01:38:05.583 --> 01:38:07.791
Give him space,
and he'll show off too much!

01:38:24.250 --> 01:38:25.333
It's the exact same tattoo.

01:38:53.125 --> 01:38:54.000
Let's start.

01:38:55.083 --> 01:38:58.291
My neighbor is downstairs.
She'll tell on me to my mom.

01:38:59.208 --> 01:39:01.750
<i>I will come back for sure</i>
<i>with another cheap thing you did…</i>

01:39:02.041 --> 01:39:03.750
<i>to prove you are not bad but the worst.</i>

01:39:03.958 --> 01:39:05.958
<i>Enough of you drama, you filthy mongrel!</i>

01:39:07.875 --> 01:39:09.916
-Guys, let's start.
-Dude…

01:39:10.708 --> 01:39:11.583
Well, he has started!

01:39:12.041 --> 01:39:13.333
She is also at fault.

01:39:13.791 --> 01:39:16.458
But now, she created a scene
as if only I am at fault.

01:39:17.375 --> 01:39:19.250
I feel like I'm a very cheap fellow.

01:39:19.458 --> 01:39:21.875
Dude, no. You aren't a cheap fellow.

01:39:22.291 --> 01:39:23.166
You're a…

01:39:23.250 --> 01:39:24.583
-filthy fellow!
-Hey!

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.208
It's true, but she also played with him.

01:39:27.625 --> 01:39:30.958
Oh, God! Played?! If a girl
introduces anyone as her brother,

01:39:31.041 --> 01:39:32.916
then that means we've
been played on by them.

01:39:33.916 --> 01:39:36.500
I'm indeed a bad guy,
but I'm not very bad.

01:39:37.291 --> 01:39:40.500
I'm a bit of a good guy,
but I'm not very good. As simple as that.

01:39:41.166 --> 01:39:44.541
Look how's he talking. He was
perfect, but now he's blabbing.

01:39:44.750 --> 01:39:47.458
-Dude, let's start.
-Yes, please.

01:39:47.666 --> 01:39:49.541
-I'll drink on your behalf.
-Cheers.

01:39:49.625 --> 01:39:51.791
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

01:39:57.458 --> 01:40:00.000
Pradeep, Dinesh is back!

01:40:04.416 --> 01:40:05.958
<i>Why is everyone laughing at him?</i>

01:40:06.666 --> 01:40:09.000
<i>Why didn't I laugh? Because…</i>

01:40:24.083 --> 01:40:24.958
On cloud nine?

01:40:27.625 --> 01:40:28.500
Yes, dude.

01:40:28.833 --> 01:40:30.208
Remember I told you about Priya?

01:40:31.458 --> 01:40:32.666
Yes, you showed me her Insta profile.

01:40:32.750 --> 01:40:35.083
Yes. Looks like she saw me
at the bus stand today.

01:40:35.333 --> 01:40:37.291
She said I was looking
cute in this pink shirt.

01:40:37.875 --> 01:40:39.416
She admires me.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:40.916
Dude--

01:40:42.083 --> 01:40:44.041
It's the most beautiful feeling in the…

01:40:44.791 --> 01:40:45.916
world!

01:40:48.083 --> 01:40:50.166
-Dude, I feel she is a hooker.
-Hey!

01:40:53.166 --> 01:40:54.291
I'm in love with her.

01:40:55.416 --> 01:40:57.541
Sorry, dude. I'm sorry.

01:41:05.791 --> 01:41:08.666
<i>-I'm in your college.</i>
<i>-What?!</i>

01:41:10.791 --> 01:41:13.000
<i>Yes. I'm here to attend</i>
<i>the ECE department symposium.</i>

01:41:13.291 --> 01:41:15.791
<i>But actually,</i>
<i>that's just an excuse to see you.</i>

01:41:16.375 --> 01:41:17.500
<i>Where are you, darling?</i>

01:41:18.208 --> 01:41:19.083
<i>At the canteen.</i>

01:41:19.166 --> 01:41:20.958
<i>Let's have a coffee and have lots of fun!</i>

01:41:21.666 --> 01:41:23.583
<i>Oh, God. I'll be there in a jiffy.</i>

01:41:24.666 --> 01:41:26.958
Uthaman, I forgot to tell you.

01:41:27.041 --> 01:41:28.333
I got a scholarship.

01:41:28.583 --> 01:41:30.291
-Awesome, dude!
-Yes, dude.

01:41:30.458 --> 01:41:32.916
I must rush to the admin block.
Please inform ma'am.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:33.833
Okay.

01:41:37.083 --> 01:41:37.958
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

01:41:39.375 --> 01:41:40.250
<i>I'm waiting.</i>

01:41:47.541 --> 01:41:49.208
<i>I'll definitely kiss her today.</i>

01:41:49.875 --> 01:41:50.875
Two orange juice.

01:41:53.083 --> 01:41:54.208
One orange juice…

01:41:55.375 --> 01:41:56.291
but with two straws.

01:42:06.041 --> 01:42:08.416
So, dude,
why are you not in the admin block?

01:42:09.875 --> 01:42:12.083
Buddy, I kept a secret from you.

01:42:12.958 --> 01:42:15.125
Actually, Priya is here in our college.

01:42:15.750 --> 01:42:18.000
I came here to see her.

01:42:21.916 --> 01:42:23.625
So, if you all don't mind…

01:42:28.625 --> 01:42:30.166
If we leave, how will you meet Priya?

01:42:30.791 --> 01:42:31.625
I don't understand.

01:42:31.708 --> 01:42:33.958
-We are your Priya.
-We are your Priya.

01:42:56.625 --> 01:42:58.708
<i>We created a fake account</i>
<i>called "Priya_Sweety."</i>

01:42:59.083 --> 01:43:02.666
<i>Many of us used this account</i>
<i>in college for various reasons.</i>

01:43:02.916 --> 01:43:04.000
<i>To get back at people we hated.</i>

01:43:09.416 --> 01:43:11.333
<i>My hero is the best!</i>

01:43:13.458 --> 01:43:14.625
<i>Reveal a little more, please.</i>

01:43:20.375 --> 01:43:22.083
<i>It's a medical emergency.</i>
<i>My mother is ill.</i>

01:43:22.416 --> 01:43:25.291
<i>I need 10,000 rupees.</i>
<i>I'll return it as soon as my dad returns.</i>

01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:31.416
I used it to check my ex's status.

01:43:32.875 --> 01:43:35.125
<i>Yes, you got it right.</i>

01:43:35.291 --> 01:43:38.458
<i>This account changes gender now and then.</i>

01:43:38.666 --> 01:43:39.875
<i>And everybody has it.</i>

01:43:40.083 --> 01:43:43.291
<i>So, all that we are</i>
<i>afraid of getting caught…</i>

01:43:43.541 --> 01:43:44.791
<i>we used to do with that fake account.</i>

01:43:45.125 --> 01:43:46.375
The problem now is that…

01:43:50.666 --> 01:43:51.958
that account is still…

01:43:54.333 --> 01:43:55.208
in use and logged in.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:43:59.041
<i>Today's headlines!</i>

01:43:59.333 --> 01:44:01.208
<i>Four cybercriminals have been arrested!</i>

01:44:01.583 --> 01:44:04.666
<i>This innocent-looking man</i>
<i>is Uthaman Pradeep</i>

01:44:04.791 --> 01:44:07.750
<i>from Sunnambu Kaalvai.</i>

01:44:08.166 --> 01:44:11.583
<i>A nice guy during the day</i>
<i>and a playboy at night.</i>

01:44:12.458 --> 01:44:16.041
<i>He seduces many guys by talking in</i>
<i>a girl's voice. He is Lusty Gopal.</i>

01:44:16.416 --> 01:44:18.666
<i>He trolls actors</i>
<i>by posting vulgar comments…</i>

01:44:18.750 --> 01:44:22.875
<i>and sparks fights between fans.</i>
<i>He is Hardcore Mani.</i>

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.666
<i>He stalks strangers online</i>
<i>as a man and a woman</i>

01:44:25.791 --> 01:44:28.958
<i>and uses FaceApp to portray himself</i>
<i>as a woman to flirt with boys.</i>

01:44:29.041 --> 01:44:31.583
<i>He's Liar Bhaskar.</i>

01:44:31.708 --> 01:44:34.041
<i>They use the fake id "Priya_Sweety."</i>

01:44:34.291 --> 01:44:36.208
<i>Beware of this fake ID.</i>

01:44:42.458 --> 01:44:44.125
-Disgusting!
-Dude, before she finds out--

01:44:47.625 --> 01:44:49.625
Don't answer it. Let it be.

01:44:51.916 --> 01:44:52.750
Hey!

01:44:53.333 --> 01:44:54.208
Hello.

01:44:54.708 --> 01:44:55.791
I just saw it.

01:44:56.583 --> 01:44:58.833
I had said that I'd prove
you're the worst…

01:44:59.083 --> 01:45:01.541
but I understood that no one
can stoop down to your level.

01:45:02.291 --> 01:45:04.333
Nikitha, actually,
I wanted to tell you before.

01:45:04.416 --> 01:45:06.458
Why have you told everyone
that you're still single?

01:45:07.375 --> 01:45:08.666
She hasn't seen the fake ID yet.

01:45:09.958 --> 01:45:12.333
Well, that was just to show off.
I wanted to look cool.

01:45:12.583 --> 01:45:14.833
What's cool about saying you're
single when you have a girlfriend?

01:45:15.041 --> 01:45:17.875
Nikitha, people look down on committed
people thinking they are cringey.

01:45:18.291 --> 01:45:19.750
It's happening right in front of me.

01:45:20.208 --> 01:45:21.208
Pradeep…

01:45:21.791 --> 01:45:23.583
are you keeping any secrets from me?

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:25.833
Not at all.

01:45:26.250 --> 01:45:27.166
Not at all?

01:45:28.541 --> 01:45:29.375
Not at all.

01:45:29.708 --> 01:45:33.416
The puppy you gave me was given
to you by your ex Sophie, right?

01:45:33.708 --> 01:45:35.041
And you gifted it to me?!

01:45:35.333 --> 01:45:37.250
Do you how it makes me feel?

01:45:37.500 --> 01:45:41.500
-Am I a dustbin? Do I look like a dustbin?
-No!

01:45:41.583 --> 01:45:44.416
My head's bursting
and my temper is raising!

01:45:44.791 --> 01:45:47.500
-When I look at this dog--
-Hold on!

01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:51.166
-Hold on!
-I want to--

01:45:51.250 --> 01:45:52.291
Hold on!

01:45:53.750 --> 01:45:54.833
Listen, Sophie.

01:45:54.916 --> 01:45:56.708
-Sophie? Did you just call me Sophie?
<i>-No!</i>

01:45:56.791 --> 01:45:58.916
-Did you just call me Sophie? Really?
<i>-No!</i>

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.750
No! You're not Sophie.

01:46:04.500 --> 01:46:05.750
Nikitha…

01:46:06.500 --> 01:46:08.375
I'll explain everything to you tomorrow.

01:46:08.458 --> 01:46:10.041
Let's meet tomorrow.

01:46:10.208 --> 01:46:12.875
There's nothing to explain!
I've understood everything!

01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:16.166
Just once, tomorrow. Please for my sake.

01:46:18.875 --> 01:46:20.208
<i>-For my sake.</i>
-Bye!

01:46:20.666 --> 01:46:22.291
At Mango Tree Restaurant, okay?

01:46:23.625 --> 01:46:24.500
Bye.

01:46:26.125 --> 01:46:27.000
Bye.

01:46:28.708 --> 01:46:29.583
Dude…

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:31.416
any update from the hacker?

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:32.958
If they click on it…

01:46:33.083 --> 01:46:34.458
I'll hack it!

01:46:36.958 --> 01:46:37.833
Get lost!

01:46:40.666 --> 01:46:43.166
Please pray that she must not
find the fake ID until tomorrow.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:49.375
-Save us, God! Bless us all!
-Save us, God! Bless us all!

01:46:49.458 --> 01:46:51.583
-Save us, God! Bless us all!
-Amen.

01:46:51.666 --> 01:46:53.791
-Move.
-Your wedding reception is in five hours.

01:46:54.291 --> 01:46:56.875
Wrong. It is in four and a half hours.

01:46:58.500 --> 01:47:00.000
Damn, it's scorching hot out here.

01:47:00.375 --> 01:47:01.291
Indeed.

01:47:06.750 --> 01:47:07.666
Take a hike.

01:47:11.791 --> 01:47:14.333
Did you check out the meme I sent you?

01:47:15.125 --> 01:47:15.958
No, I didn't.

01:47:16.291 --> 01:47:17.500
It's very funny. Check it out.

01:47:28.208 --> 01:47:29.208
Not funny at all.

01:47:30.041 --> 01:47:30.916
Bad joke.

01:47:35.541 --> 01:47:37.000
Remember how you all made fun of me?

01:47:37.125 --> 01:47:39.125
Now, everyone will make fun of you all!

01:47:39.208 --> 01:47:40.250
Where's Pradeep, dude?

01:47:47.083 --> 01:47:51.000
<i>A smooth talker who convinces girls</i>
<i>to send their sensitive photos…</i>

01:47:51.083 --> 01:47:53.333
<i>Pervert Kamesh has also been arrested.</i>

01:47:58.708 --> 01:48:01.708
So, he went to meet her to log out from
that account without her knowledge.

01:48:21.083 --> 01:48:22.541
Why go so far just to log out?

01:48:23.125 --> 01:48:24.208
Hope you know the password.

01:48:27.125 --> 01:48:29.708
Okay, log into that account
from some mobile here.

01:48:30.333 --> 01:48:33.666
Then, click on "log out from all devices,"
and it'll log out from his phone as well.

01:48:36.916 --> 01:48:38.125
He's not someone who'd do wrong.

01:48:38.625 --> 01:48:40.291
He's a mastermind who does
wrong and has a clean slate.

01:48:40.916 --> 01:48:42.166
-Let me inform Divya--
-Hey!

01:48:42.500 --> 01:48:43.708
First, call Pradeep and tell him to stop.

01:48:44.750 --> 01:48:46.166
Nikitha, I'll be sitting there.

01:48:49.958 --> 01:48:50.833
Why is he here?

01:48:51.458 --> 01:48:53.166
For emotional support.

01:48:53.791 --> 01:48:55.583
He's always been there for me.

01:48:55.750 --> 01:48:56.750
Then what about me?

01:48:57.541 --> 01:48:58.416
You are there…

01:48:58.958 --> 01:49:01.125
to tell every girl that you're single,

01:49:01.208 --> 01:49:04.333
to ask for their photos, and to talk dirty
about them. You are there to do that.

01:49:04.416 --> 01:49:06.916
Nikitha, that's how boys talk in a group.

01:49:07.291 --> 01:49:09.000
In the same group,
I abused Mani by calling him a--

01:49:09.083 --> 01:49:10.291
-Hey!
-I abused him like that,

01:49:10.583 --> 01:49:12.541
but it doesn't mean
I'm talking ill of his mother.

01:49:12.666 --> 01:49:14.833
Even he knows it.
Only girls misunderstand it.

01:49:15.041 --> 01:49:17.416
Oh. Then, why do you advertise
that you're single?

01:49:18.666 --> 01:49:20.916
Oh, that? Give me my mobile.
I'll explain it to you.

01:49:21.583 --> 01:49:22.500
What?

01:49:22.583 --> 01:49:24.333
Give it to me. Everything's in it.

01:49:24.708 --> 01:49:25.625
Give it to me.

01:49:29.083 --> 01:49:29.916
Answer it.

01:49:33.166 --> 01:49:34.583
-Hello?
-Dude!

01:49:34.875 --> 01:49:36.833
We'll log in from here
and log out from all devices.

01:49:36.916 --> 01:49:38.208
<i>You don't have to do anything.</i>

01:49:38.958 --> 01:49:40.583
Super. Okay.

01:49:41.875 --> 01:49:42.833
Dude, log in now.

01:49:43.041 --> 01:49:43.958
-What is it?
<i>-Stay online.</i>

01:49:44.041 --> 01:49:45.208
<i>-He's doing it now.</i>
-Nothing.

01:49:45.625 --> 01:49:48.041
-Raisins in sweet--
-Dude, two more seconds.

01:49:48.291 --> 01:49:49.500
Come on, spit it out.

01:49:49.875 --> 01:49:51.083
I swear, it's nothing.

01:49:51.458 --> 01:49:52.833
That is all, Nikitha.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:55.083
I just came to say that.

01:49:55.333 --> 01:49:57.708
I'm getting late for the reception. See.

01:49:58.291 --> 01:50:00.125
So, it was nice meeting you.

01:50:01.583 --> 01:50:02.458
Yeah.

01:50:03.375 --> 01:50:04.291
Have a nice day.

01:50:07.833 --> 01:50:08.666
Dude…

01:50:09.291 --> 01:50:10.458
it says, "An OTP has been sent."

01:50:16.875 --> 01:50:19.375
Wait. Just a second. Give it to me.

01:50:19.458 --> 01:50:22.083
-Let me see the message first.
-No, give it to me.

01:50:22.166 --> 01:50:24.625
-Give it to me just once.
-No way!

01:50:24.708 --> 01:50:26.875
Let go of it!

01:50:27.541 --> 01:50:29.250
-Don't bite me!
-Give it to me.

01:50:29.416 --> 01:50:30.333
Let go of it!

01:50:33.083 --> 01:50:34.000
Sir, order.

01:50:35.500 --> 01:50:37.083
-Give us a few minutes
-Okay, sir.

01:50:38.666 --> 01:50:40.125
Let it go!

01:50:49.125 --> 01:50:49.958
Thank you, sir.

01:50:51.208 --> 01:50:52.583
Give it to me!

01:50:52.666 --> 01:50:54.416
I won't! Hey, stop it!

01:50:54.666 --> 01:50:55.750
-I'll bite you!
-Let go!

01:50:57.125 --> 01:50:58.041
Give it to me!

01:51:01.333 --> 01:51:02.166
What happened?

01:51:02.708 --> 01:51:03.583
Nothing.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:05.875
I faked it.

01:51:06.458 --> 01:51:08.375
Haven't you done the same to me?

01:51:20.250 --> 01:51:22.250
Why are you getting an OTP
for some other account?

01:51:23.041 --> 01:51:23.875
OTP?

01:51:24.250 --> 01:51:25.083
Show me.

01:51:29.833 --> 01:51:33.708
If he's got an OTP, then that means
someone else has logged into the account.

01:51:37.625 --> 01:51:39.500
He handles a fake account
called "Priya_Sweety."

01:51:45.125 --> 01:51:46.000
Go to the profile tab.

01:51:46.375 --> 01:51:48.250
You'll find an option
called "Switch accounts."

01:51:48.916 --> 01:51:49.958
Shall I go and wait there?

01:51:50.541 --> 01:51:51.375
Sit here.

01:52:10.958 --> 01:52:11.916
Bro, why are you looking--

01:52:17.708 --> 01:52:18.541
What now?

01:52:18.666 --> 01:52:19.541
Shame on you!

01:52:20.666 --> 01:52:23.875
How can you send such obscene
messages to my sister?

01:52:24.791 --> 01:52:25.750
To your sister?

01:52:26.416 --> 01:52:28.833
Please, stop acting! Enough!

01:52:29.500 --> 01:52:33.458
Wait. So, the other day, I spoke to you
about a fake account that <i>you</i> handle?!

01:52:34.250 --> 01:52:36.166
I was such a fool!

01:52:36.250 --> 01:52:37.416
Hey, what happened?

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:43.458
Remember I told you that I was getting
obscene messages from an account?

01:52:43.625 --> 01:52:46.708
<i>You and your sister look awesome.</i>
<i>Shall I come over for the night?</i>

01:52:46.875 --> 01:52:49.583
Just block him.
It'd be petty to file a cyber complaint.

01:52:51.208 --> 01:52:52.375
It was from this account.

01:52:53.041 --> 01:52:55.125
<i>Can I send you nudes? I am desperate.</i>

01:52:55.416 --> 01:52:57.291
<i>-Shall I bathe you?</i>
<i>-Upload a new reel.</i>

01:52:57.375 --> 01:52:59.750
<i>Is there any combo offer</i>
<i>on you and your sister?</i>

01:52:59.916 --> 01:53:00.875
<i>Let's watch porn together.</i>

01:53:00.958 --> 01:53:02.541
<i>Sleep with me, and I'll pay you 10,000.</i>

01:53:05.583 --> 01:53:06.875
My head's bursting.

01:53:08.750 --> 01:53:09.583
Nikitha!

01:53:10.041 --> 01:53:12.833
I don't know what this is.
I don't understand at all.

01:53:13.041 --> 01:53:14.875
So, the mobile typed
the message and sent it?!

01:53:17.625 --> 01:53:19.375
Nikitha, I'm not the only
one who uses this account.

01:53:20.166 --> 01:53:21.708
All my friends use this account.

01:53:22.625 --> 01:53:26.250
I just used to use it
to check my ex's status.

01:53:29.583 --> 01:53:31.333
How do your friends know my sister?

01:53:32.250 --> 01:53:34.583
How did they send the same message
to me and my sister at once?

01:53:34.833 --> 01:53:37.000
Pradeep, do not lie to me!

01:53:37.708 --> 01:53:40.041
Tell me, are you a psychopath?
Are you?

01:53:40.416 --> 01:53:41.583
Were you testing my loyalty?

01:53:41.750 --> 01:53:44.500
What was that? You'll pay me
10,000 rupees to sleep with you?!

01:53:45.791 --> 01:53:48.833
You don't have the courage to ask me
that in person, so you did it this way?!

01:53:49.583 --> 01:53:52.416
-Nikitha, I didn't do it.
-Hey…

01:53:52.500 --> 01:53:54.250
you need a doctor.

01:53:54.416 --> 01:53:56.625
-So many sex chats!
-Nikitha, it wasn't me.

01:53:56.708 --> 01:53:58.583
You even tricked many to get money!

01:53:58.916 --> 01:54:01.250
Hey, my friends did that.

01:54:02.416 --> 01:54:03.250
Oh…

01:54:03.916 --> 01:54:06.166
so your friends sent me
those obscene messages?!

01:54:06.250 --> 01:54:07.583
I didn't mean that.

01:54:07.666 --> 01:54:09.125
You were just quietly watching it?!

01:54:09.375 --> 01:54:10.708
-Wow!
-Listen to me--

01:54:11.041 --> 01:54:12.958
-Look!
-You've got awesome friends.

01:54:13.291 --> 01:54:14.875
-Nikitha--
-You've got awesome friends!

01:54:15.083 --> 01:54:17.791
Nikitha, I had no idea that
such things were happening.

01:54:18.375 --> 01:54:20.916
My friends usually don't
indulge in such stuff.

01:54:21.458 --> 01:54:22.583
What else?

01:54:22.833 --> 01:54:26.000
Not just my friends but a lot
of them use this account.

01:54:26.708 --> 01:54:27.625
Oh, God!

01:54:28.500 --> 01:54:29.833
How many of them indulge in…

01:54:30.625 --> 01:54:35.083
harassing girls and abusing friends by
calling out their mom's name? Disgusting!

01:54:37.791 --> 01:54:40.458
It's a shame that you
are using this account.

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.333
It's not only shameful but also cheap!

01:54:43.500 --> 01:54:45.875
Psycho! Pervert! I am lost for words!

01:54:46.416 --> 01:54:47.625
I didn't do it, Nikitha.

01:54:47.708 --> 01:54:49.833
You think you can do anything
hiding behind a mask?!

01:54:50.625 --> 01:54:51.666
What did you say?

01:54:52.208 --> 01:54:53.458
"Just" block the ID?!

01:54:53.875 --> 01:54:56.500
You'll again create a new
account and post comments…

01:54:56.583 --> 01:54:59.750
-I didn't do it, Nikitha.
-and we must endure it all.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:00.916
Don't touch me!

01:55:02.375 --> 01:55:04.000
You want to talk to my sister?

01:55:04.583 --> 01:55:06.000
Then why did you approach me?

01:55:06.541 --> 01:55:07.708
Or you're after both of us?!

01:55:08.375 --> 01:55:10.250
Nikitha, you're crossing the limits!

01:55:10.583 --> 01:55:12.583
You very well know
I wouldn't do such a thing.

01:55:12.833 --> 01:55:15.458
Just because you found this,
don't try to turn the tables on me!

01:55:15.583 --> 01:55:16.458
Excuse me?

01:55:17.416 --> 01:55:20.875
You do such cheap things, and you're
comparing them with my faults?!

01:55:21.500 --> 01:55:24.541
Yes, I am,
because I didn't do any of that.

01:55:24.791 --> 01:55:27.750
I didn't drive all the way to Pondicherry
for a sleepover with my ex.

01:55:28.083 --> 01:55:31.125
I didn't take anyone around saying
they are like my brother or sister.

01:55:31.500 --> 01:55:34.583
If you've received the OTP,
it means you're the account holder.

01:55:34.916 --> 01:55:36.875
-How can you blame someone else?!
-You'd better keep quiet!

01:55:42.208 --> 01:55:45.000
Look, Nikitha.
Yes, I did create this account…

01:55:45.333 --> 01:55:47.541
but those chats… I didn't do it.

01:55:48.666 --> 01:55:50.041
If I'm wrong, then I will accept it.

01:55:50.125 --> 01:55:53.583
Earlier, when you confronted me,
I accepted it because I was at fault.

01:55:53.833 --> 01:55:56.625
But when I say I didn't do it,
I honestly mean that I didn't do it!

01:55:56.708 --> 01:55:58.041
I didn't do it! I didn't!

01:56:00.500 --> 01:56:02.000
Thanks to my father for doing this.

01:56:03.791 --> 01:56:05.583
Or else, a guy like you--

01:56:06.750 --> 01:56:07.625
Disgusting!

01:56:08.708 --> 01:56:12.041
Pradeep, everybody told me…

01:56:13.291 --> 01:56:16.208
to stay away from you, but…

01:56:20.291 --> 01:56:23.500
Nikitha, look. I'll call my friends.
Listen to what they have to say.

01:56:23.625 --> 01:56:27.333
Like what? That they sent me obscene
messages, and you did nothing about it?!

01:56:27.416 --> 01:56:30.000
Wait. Just a moment.

01:56:30.083 --> 01:56:31.875
-Wait, just a second. Hold on.
-Stop it!

01:56:32.833 --> 01:56:36.083
Would you have been quiet if someone
had sent such messages to your sister?

01:56:36.458 --> 01:56:37.916
Nikitha, check that account properly.

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.500
He might've hit on your sister.
After all, his identity was hidden.

01:56:42.458 --> 01:56:44.833
Let go of him! Let go!

01:56:45.125 --> 01:56:48.000
Pradeep, let go of him!

01:56:54.041 --> 01:56:55.291
-Sir!
-Please, sir!

01:56:55.708 --> 01:56:56.791
Please, sir.

01:57:01.625 --> 01:57:02.541
Let go of me.

01:57:04.875 --> 01:57:06.375
Hands off me. Give me that.

01:57:09.041 --> 01:57:10.041
It's okay, Nikitha.

01:57:10.583 --> 01:57:12.250
I'd have knocked him down with one blow.

01:57:12.833 --> 01:57:14.916
I was quiet because I wanted
you to see his true colors.

01:57:16.708 --> 01:57:17.750
Yeah, right.

01:57:18.291 --> 01:57:21.250
Don't believe the truth.
Always fall for lies.

01:57:21.333 --> 01:57:22.625
You want to roam with him, don't you?

01:57:22.708 --> 01:57:24.458
-Sir…
-Isn't that why you blamed me?

01:57:24.583 --> 01:57:25.500
Let go!

01:57:26.041 --> 01:57:29.625
Go and roam around with him!
Just go!

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:30.833
I am sorry.

01:57:31.125 --> 01:57:33.083
-I'm saying I didn't do it…
-Sir, leave it.

01:57:33.625 --> 01:57:34.500
Hey!

01:57:35.083 --> 01:57:38.333
Go! Just go with him! Crap!

01:57:43.791 --> 01:57:46.375
What perfect timing!
A call from Mamakutty!

01:57:47.708 --> 01:57:48.583
Hang up, you--

01:58:22.208 --> 01:58:23.416
Just for a second, please.

01:58:24.083 --> 01:58:25.208
Hey! Pulthish!

01:58:25.666 --> 01:58:28.875
Hey, stop! Give me back my phone!

01:58:29.750 --> 01:58:31.750
Mom!

01:58:31.875 --> 01:58:33.291
Dude, why would we do such a thing?

01:58:33.833 --> 01:58:36.458
Hey, many of them are using that account…

01:58:37.166 --> 01:58:40.500
but none of them know that
Nikitha and Shweta are sisters.

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.291
Both of them are getting the messages
at the same time, which means…

01:58:43.875 --> 01:58:45.375
it is definitely someone among you.

01:58:46.125 --> 01:58:48.375
Pradeep, Nikitha is like a sister to me.

01:58:48.458 --> 01:58:50.958
Please! Enough!

01:58:51.625 --> 01:58:54.666
Enough with the sister sentiments!

01:58:54.750 --> 01:58:58.625
Hey, didn't you want her
to believe that you didn't do it?

01:58:58.791 --> 01:59:01.583
We are in that same situation.
Believe us, we didn't do it.

01:59:02.875 --> 01:59:05.166
I didn't lay a finger on you.
Why are you crying?

01:59:05.250 --> 01:59:06.541
Hey, what happened?

01:59:07.666 --> 01:59:10.416
I saw a photo in which he was wearing
boxers and standing next to a woman.

01:59:10.500 --> 01:59:12.291
-He hit me because of that!
-He hit you?!

01:59:12.375 --> 01:59:14.750
Hey, I didn't hit him.
I just snatched the cell phone.

01:59:15.166 --> 01:59:16.333
Does it hurt?

01:59:16.500 --> 01:59:19.125
Pulthish, don't lie.
I didn't lay a finger on you.

01:59:19.416 --> 01:59:20.666
If you take other people's phones,

01:59:20.750 --> 01:59:22.208
you'll have to face
such consequences! Come!

01:59:22.375 --> 01:59:24.416
I need the phone just for a second.

01:59:24.666 --> 01:59:26.041
He wants it just for a second!

01:59:26.458 --> 01:59:30.125
-I may get important calls.
-God! Please! Just for a second!

01:59:30.333 --> 01:59:33.166
Just for a second! Only one second!

01:59:33.250 --> 01:59:34.875
-Please!
-For my sake, give it to him once.

01:59:34.958 --> 01:59:36.541
For just one second! Please!

01:59:36.750 --> 01:59:41.458
For just a second! Only one second!

01:59:50.208 --> 01:59:51.166
One second's over.

01:59:55.916 --> 01:59:58.666
He is showing off that he owns
an iPhone and we don't!

01:59:58.750 --> 02:00:00.125
This is an atrocity!

02:00:00.791 --> 02:00:02.541
-So, it wasn't you guys?
-No.

02:00:04.041 --> 02:00:05.583
-You guys didn't do it?
-No!

02:00:09.666 --> 02:00:10.625
What about you?

02:00:11.833 --> 02:00:13.333
Dude, come on.

02:00:13.791 --> 02:00:14.916
Fuck!

02:00:17.541 --> 02:00:19.916
You had already messaged
my girlfriend long back.

02:00:20.291 --> 02:00:21.750
You knew her before me…

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:25.208
but when I introduced you,
both of you acted really well.

02:00:25.875 --> 02:00:27.125
-Dude, well…
-Hey…

02:00:27.750 --> 02:00:29.125
stop accusing him unnecessarily.

02:00:30.791 --> 02:00:33.750
Really? Wait a minute.

02:00:34.041 --> 02:00:36.416
I just saw his messages to her
on my way here. I'll show you.

02:00:36.500 --> 02:00:38.833
"Hey, girl with a beautiful coiffure,
good morning.

02:00:39.583 --> 02:00:41.416
Hey, angel, you're awake!

02:00:42.791 --> 02:00:44.666
Good morning, you beauty."

02:00:46.125 --> 02:00:47.208
Are you admiring her?

02:00:48.958 --> 02:00:50.250
Buddy, that was a long time ago.

02:00:50.375 --> 02:00:51.250
Shut up!

02:00:53.416 --> 02:00:54.708
That'd be wrong, right?

02:00:54.916 --> 02:00:55.958
It'd be a blunder!

02:00:56.083 --> 02:00:58.208
Only cheapos who doubt their
girlfriends do such things.

02:00:59.041 --> 02:01:01.208
Pradeep, he wouldn't have hit on her.

02:01:01.625 --> 02:01:02.541
What?!

02:01:02.666 --> 02:01:06.708
Dude… he tried to woo
his friend's girlfriend,

02:01:07.041 --> 02:01:08.500
and you are supporting him?!

02:01:12.208 --> 02:01:14.000
I'm now doubting all of you.

02:01:14.125 --> 02:01:15.500
-Hey…
-Dude, come on.

02:01:15.583 --> 02:01:17.041
So, you guys were together in this?!

02:01:17.458 --> 02:01:19.125
-Pradeep, you're talking nonsense!
-No!

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.708
I don't want anyone here.
All of you, out.

02:01:22.791 --> 02:01:23.666
Let's talk it out--

02:01:23.750 --> 02:01:25.958
Get out! I'll finish you off! Get lost!

02:01:45.291 --> 02:01:46.708
Listen…

02:01:47.416 --> 02:01:48.666
why aren't you giving me the phone?

02:01:49.458 --> 02:01:50.333
Why do you want it?

02:02:16.958 --> 02:02:18.958
-Sorry.
-Come on, Mom.

02:02:30.541 --> 02:02:31.375
Hey!

02:02:35.583 --> 02:02:37.833
Hey!

02:02:38.791 --> 02:02:39.625
Look here.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.041
Mom, I'm sorry.

02:02:42.166 --> 02:02:43.208
Please leave me alone.

02:02:43.750 --> 02:02:44.916
What happened?

02:02:45.416 --> 02:02:47.625
Nothing, Mom. You carry on.
I'll handle it.

02:02:49.041 --> 02:02:49.958
Hey…

02:02:50.541 --> 02:02:51.458
look here.

02:02:51.916 --> 02:02:54.291
I can tell when there is something wrong.

02:02:54.666 --> 02:02:56.666
I'm your mother. Now, tell me.

02:03:05.666 --> 02:03:06.625
Hey…

02:03:10.875 --> 02:03:12.125
Hey.

02:03:13.791 --> 02:03:14.666
Hey.

02:03:16.708 --> 02:03:17.666
What happened?

02:03:21.833 --> 02:03:23.500
What happened?

02:03:23.791 --> 02:03:25.416
Nothing. You carry on.

02:03:26.666 --> 02:03:28.250
What happened?

02:03:30.208 --> 02:03:31.125
Tell me, what happened?

02:03:36.791 --> 02:03:37.791
Come on, tell me.

02:03:39.666 --> 02:03:42.291
Everyone's betraying me, Mom.

02:03:46.166 --> 02:03:47.250
What are you saying?

02:03:47.750 --> 02:03:48.875
I couldn't believe it.

02:03:49.541 --> 02:03:53.416
But Revi says he has heard
worse things about Pradeep.

02:03:53.583 --> 02:03:55.041
-What?
-Yes.

02:03:55.333 --> 02:03:58.833
-Revi doesn't have a reason to lie--
-Don't listen to anybody else.

02:03:59.333 --> 02:04:00.375
What do <i>you</i> feel?

02:04:02.333 --> 02:04:03.416
So, this is the issue!

02:04:04.208 --> 02:04:07.000
A lot of boys are drooling over her.

02:04:07.416 --> 02:04:08.333
And she…

02:04:09.833 --> 02:04:13.166
she is not reciprocating,
but she keeps replying to all of them.

02:04:14.125 --> 02:04:16.833
Can't she just ask them
to shut up and get lost?

02:04:18.166 --> 02:04:19.166
Did she cross any limits…

02:04:20.041 --> 02:04:21.375
He talks to girls casually,

02:04:22.083 --> 02:04:24.750
but I'm worried that there's
some wrong motive behind it.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:26.541
First of all, why must he talk to them?

02:04:27.125 --> 02:04:30.000
Okay… but how does
Revi know about all this?

02:04:30.250 --> 02:04:31.291
I told him.

02:04:33.500 --> 02:04:34.583
Your friends?!

02:04:35.541 --> 02:04:37.208
I don't know whom to trust.

02:04:37.958 --> 02:04:41.791
I felt Divya was also falling
into the same trap, so I…

02:04:43.625 --> 02:04:46.125
Why did you tell Revi
about what's going on between you two?

02:04:46.875 --> 02:04:49.916
How would you feel if Pradeep discussed
your personal matters with another girl?

02:04:54.333 --> 02:04:55.708
Well, Revi isn't such a fellow.

02:04:55.958 --> 02:04:58.291
He always wanted my
and Pradeep's relationship to work.

02:04:58.583 --> 02:05:00.083
He wanted that, my foot!

02:05:01.375 --> 02:05:02.208
Pradeep…

02:05:03.208 --> 02:05:05.041
right from schools
to colleges and offices…

02:05:05.583 --> 02:05:08.666
everywhere, one or the other guy
will drool over every girl.

02:05:09.333 --> 02:05:10.500
This is not new.

02:05:12.291 --> 02:05:13.208
You know what…

02:05:14.166 --> 02:05:15.833
it has also happened to me.

02:05:17.125 --> 02:05:19.583
Many of them will have wrong intentions…

02:05:20.083 --> 02:05:22.291
but they'd never dare
to make that mistake.

02:05:23.250 --> 02:05:24.208
They won't have the guts.

02:05:29.958 --> 02:05:31.208
Hey, what happened?

02:05:32.125 --> 02:05:35.041
I couldn't leave you
alone in this situation.

02:05:35.916 --> 02:05:38.083
It is impossible to chase them away.

02:05:38.583 --> 02:05:41.583
Girls have to work, study,
and travel along with such boys.

02:05:42.083 --> 02:05:44.000
They will always be around.

02:05:44.250 --> 02:05:46.583
I cannot see you suffer like this.

02:05:46.916 --> 02:05:50.291
You deserve better.
Girls like you are very rare to find.

02:05:52.791 --> 02:05:53.625
Hey…

02:05:56.833 --> 02:05:58.916
But no matter what those guys do…

02:05:59.333 --> 02:06:01.750
they can't even go near her.

02:06:02.666 --> 02:06:05.583
You are way out of his league.
How did you fall for him?

02:06:06.333 --> 02:06:08.166
Look at his photo after five months.

02:06:08.666 --> 02:06:10.500
You'll regret to have
fallen in love with him.

02:06:12.916 --> 02:06:14.541
Actually, I want to say something to you.

02:06:16.166 --> 02:06:18.625
I don't know if I'll ever get
such a perfect opportunity again.

02:06:22.208 --> 02:06:23.791
I still love you, Nikitha.

02:06:26.166 --> 02:06:29.541
Such a guy will even sacrifice
himself to win her heart.

02:06:30.375 --> 02:06:35.708
But what he doesn't know is that
she'd never have feelings for him.

02:06:36.625 --> 02:06:38.208
Even if you don't make those sacrifices…

02:06:38.708 --> 02:06:41.041
still, she'd sacrifice herself for you.

02:06:41.333 --> 02:06:42.791
That is only if her love for you is true.

02:06:47.625 --> 02:06:48.583
-Please--
-It's okay.

02:06:49.416 --> 02:06:51.500
Give it a good thought before
making any decision.

02:06:54.583 --> 02:06:56.583
You don't trust Pradeep
because <i>he</i> told you about him?!

02:06:58.958 --> 02:07:01.458
Hey, don't tell me you didn't err at all.

02:07:03.250 --> 02:07:06.416
Mom, I talk to girls casually…

02:07:06.500 --> 02:07:08.875
Oh! Really?
As if I'm going to believe that!

02:07:09.583 --> 02:07:11.583
Even if I were sincere,
she'd have still cheated.

02:07:11.791 --> 02:07:14.333
If I had stayed innocent and sincere…

02:07:14.500 --> 02:07:17.416
and then, if I had found out about
her, it'd have killed me.

02:07:20.833 --> 02:07:24.958
If you were an honest guy,
you'd have never regretted it.

02:07:25.208 --> 02:07:28.875
She would've regretted to have
put you through all that.

02:07:29.375 --> 02:07:32.875
But at this very moment,
whatever is running in your mind…

02:07:32.958 --> 02:07:34.833
is exactly what's running
in her mind as well.

02:07:37.333 --> 02:07:41.208
Everybody wants a trustworthy partner…

02:07:41.916 --> 02:07:44.416
but none of them wants to be

02:07:44.916 --> 02:07:48.666
a trustworthy partner themselves.

02:07:49.416 --> 02:07:50.500
That's the issue.

02:07:54.791 --> 02:07:56.708
So, are you ditching her?

02:08:04.333 --> 02:08:05.208
Then, give me this.

02:08:07.791 --> 02:08:09.583
I know who gifted this to you.

02:08:09.958 --> 02:08:12.250
Now that you've decided to ditch her,
give it to me.

02:08:18.416 --> 02:08:19.291
Hey!

02:08:23.541 --> 02:08:24.500
You…

02:08:25.833 --> 02:08:32.291
<i>You are more precious to me</i>
<i>Than my life</i>

02:08:32.625 --> 02:08:38.916
<i>No matter how many births I take</i>
<i>I will ensure you are mine</i>

02:08:39.500 --> 02:08:46.000
<i>You are more precious to me</i>
<i>Than my life</i>

02:08:46.416 --> 02:08:52.875
<i>I promise you this</i>
<i>I will never give you up</i>

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.916
You handed it to me because you knew
you could get it back anytime.

02:09:02.541 --> 02:09:06.458
But when you thought it was lost forever,
you couldn't accept it.

02:09:08.458 --> 02:09:11.875
Some precious things cannot be
found again once you lose them.

02:09:14.750 --> 02:09:16.250
Well, I'm senseless,

02:09:17.583 --> 02:09:18.583
but I hope you're clever.

02:09:44.333 --> 02:09:45.333
So, then what happened?

02:09:45.791 --> 02:09:47.500
No, he is not giving me his phone.

02:09:48.208 --> 02:09:49.041
He's here.

02:09:49.875 --> 02:09:50.750
<i>It's okay, sit.</i>

02:09:51.416 --> 02:09:52.291
What's up, Pradeep?

02:09:54.500 --> 02:09:55.708
Since when you started smoking?

02:09:55.791 --> 02:09:56.833
You smoke?!

02:09:56.916 --> 02:09:58.750
-Since I was in college.
-Does your family know?

02:09:58.916 --> 02:10:01.833
I think they found out a year ago,
but they never confronted me.

02:10:02.125 --> 02:10:04.458
Once they do that,
you'll be free to smoke at home, right?

02:10:05.375 --> 02:10:07.333
Sometimes, secrets are better
if they stay secrets.

02:10:07.833 --> 02:10:09.416
Smoking is wrong that's why I'm hiding it.

02:10:09.791 --> 02:10:11.250
Why hide things if there's nothing wrong?

02:10:11.541 --> 02:10:13.583
Do you think I'm doing
something wrong, Pradeep?

02:10:14.416 --> 02:10:15.958
If not, then why don't you give it?

02:10:16.458 --> 02:10:19.791
There could be 1000 reasons.
Why don't you consider that?

02:10:21.166 --> 02:10:22.541
Ask him what reasons.

02:10:23.875 --> 02:10:25.333
Guess what your sister calls me.

02:10:28.083 --> 02:10:28.958
Dark chocolate.

02:10:32.625 --> 02:10:36.375
See. What's romantic
to me is funny to you.

02:10:37.666 --> 02:10:39.416
There are lots of such
comments on my phone.

02:10:40.750 --> 02:10:42.750
Have you ever posted selfies
and stuff on TikTok?

02:10:44.791 --> 02:10:46.583
How do your friends respond to them?

02:10:47.083 --> 02:10:49.416
-They like it. That's all.
-But guess what responses I get.

02:10:50.083 --> 02:10:51.500
Damn! Look at his face!

02:10:51.750 --> 02:10:53.250
Dude, you're one handsome guy!

02:10:53.458 --> 02:10:55.083
You look like a piece of shit!

02:10:55.208 --> 02:10:58.333
Every face has a shape,
but this fellow's face is out of shape!

02:10:58.541 --> 02:11:02.166
Even the filters
can't make you look good, dude!

02:11:02.250 --> 02:11:04.750
Look at your double chin, you fatso!

02:11:04.833 --> 02:11:10.250
I've heard of beer bellies,
but you've got cheek bellies!

02:11:17.416 --> 02:11:18.500
Have you ever noticed?

02:11:19.708 --> 02:11:21.458
Every mobile has a WhatsApp group…

02:11:22.333 --> 02:11:23.625
which is always inactive.

02:11:24.416 --> 02:11:25.458
But there'll be one guy…

02:11:25.875 --> 02:11:28.416
when they make fun of him,
the group becomes active.

02:11:29.208 --> 02:11:30.166
Guess who's that guy.

02:11:33.166 --> 02:11:36.208
They take screenshots of my face
and make memes out of them.

02:11:37.250 --> 02:11:39.916
They know that trolling me
would make everybody laugh.

02:11:40.333 --> 02:11:41.375
So, they do it on purpose.

02:11:43.416 --> 02:11:45.666
Fearing that,
I stopped putting up my photos.

02:11:48.208 --> 02:11:50.416
Last week, I sent my wedding
invitation to a friend.

02:11:51.208 --> 02:11:52.416
He shared it in the group.

02:11:53.125 --> 02:11:54.250
Guess what happened next.

02:11:54.458 --> 02:11:56.708
Such a beautiful bride for him?!
Damn, it's unacceptable!

02:11:57.041 --> 02:11:58.541
I pity that bride.

02:11:58.958 --> 02:12:02.416
Instead of tying the knot with him,
she could commit suicide.

02:12:03.500 --> 02:12:05.416
Guess what they changed
that WhatsApp group's name to.

02:12:06.750 --> 02:12:08.041
"Cutie weds King Kong."

02:12:09.375 --> 02:12:11.166
Cutie is your sister and King Kong…

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.958
<i>I thought your sister would</i>
<i>feel bad if she sees all this…</i>

02:12:16.333 --> 02:12:19.083
<i>and that would hurt me.</i>

02:12:19.916 --> 02:12:25.208
I wonder what kick or happiness
these guys get from making fun of me.

02:12:25.875 --> 02:12:28.166
Do they think they are
the best comedians?

02:12:29.541 --> 02:12:31.625
Do they ever care about my feelings?

02:12:33.291 --> 02:12:34.541
Everyone looked down on me…

02:12:36.458 --> 02:12:37.958
but Divya looked at me in a different way.

02:12:39.166 --> 02:12:40.250
She said she liked me.

02:12:43.750 --> 02:12:45.750
I was afraid that after
checking my phone,

02:12:45.833 --> 02:12:49.000
she would also start
teasing me like others.

02:12:54.583 --> 02:12:56.458
No matter how much
we delete stuff, we'll get caught.

02:12:56.666 --> 02:12:58.958
To top it all,
I've clicked body transformation photos

02:12:59.041 --> 02:13:01.166
in the name of reducing weight.

02:13:01.791 --> 02:13:05.250
Even I can't stand them!
I wonder how that kid managed to see them!

02:13:06.041 --> 02:13:08.291
You want to know who it was?
That was the lady gym trainer.

02:13:08.541 --> 02:13:11.125
I took photos in her presence.
That created unwanted…

02:13:16.125 --> 02:13:16.958
Pradeep…

02:13:17.208 --> 02:13:20.541
<i>hiding something means we don't</i>
<i>want others to know about it.</i>

02:13:20.791 --> 02:13:22.916
<i>It need not always be a wrong thing.</i>

02:13:26.166 --> 02:13:28.625
He could've told me all this.

02:13:29.125 --> 02:13:30.666
If I had, we'd have broken up long ago.

02:13:33.125 --> 02:13:35.791
Pradeep just told me that you are
listening to our conversation.

02:13:38.083 --> 02:13:39.291
Now that it has come to this…

02:14:48.125 --> 02:14:49.208
Did you check everything?

02:14:50.708 --> 02:14:51.625
What did you find?

02:14:51.916 --> 02:14:53.000
The real you.

02:14:54.375 --> 02:14:55.625
So, it's over!

02:14:56.375 --> 02:14:58.958
Well, it's just the beginning.

02:15:13.750 --> 02:15:15.458
Dude, let him come. We'll talk to him.

02:15:16.250 --> 02:15:18.166
Who else among us uses that account?

02:15:18.250 --> 02:15:19.083
No idea!

02:15:21.500 --> 02:15:23.666
-Do you suspect anybody?
-I don't even know the password.

02:15:23.750 --> 02:15:24.666
Pradeep's here.

02:15:32.416 --> 02:15:33.333
Buddy…

02:15:36.250 --> 02:15:37.333
trust me, I didn't do it.

02:15:38.208 --> 02:15:39.791
Why do you think I'd do such a thing?

02:15:40.416 --> 02:15:44.583
I did try to approach her, but that
was before you started talking to her.

02:15:47.500 --> 02:15:50.083
I was confused about whether
I should tell you this or not.

02:15:51.833 --> 02:15:52.916
I was scared.

02:15:53.583 --> 02:15:55.458
That's why I didn't tell you.

02:15:57.166 --> 02:15:59.208
Dude, I don't know if she
even remembers my face!

02:16:02.541 --> 02:16:04.375
But I promise you…

02:16:05.500 --> 02:16:07.083
that I did all that out of fear.

02:16:10.416 --> 02:16:11.416
Sorry, dude.

02:16:13.583 --> 02:16:17.041
But I swear that I didn't
message her from that fake ID.

02:16:19.291 --> 02:16:20.583
Sorry, buddy.

02:16:21.625 --> 02:16:22.541
Look at me.

02:16:24.041 --> 02:16:25.541
Sorry. Look at me.

02:16:30.416 --> 02:16:31.333
I'm sorry.

02:16:36.583 --> 02:16:38.416
I told you guys to leave.
Aren't you leaving?

02:16:39.125 --> 02:16:40.833
Stop talking like you're a thug!

02:16:40.958 --> 02:16:42.000
Why should we obey you?

02:16:42.500 --> 02:16:44.625
This is our sister's wedding.
We aren't going anywhere.

02:16:45.333 --> 02:16:47.250
I'll finish you off. Guys, I doubt him.

02:16:47.416 --> 02:16:48.583
Yeah, right. I did it.

02:16:48.791 --> 02:16:50.041
Yeah, blame me now!

02:16:50.125 --> 02:16:52.250
He washes his boxers thrice a day.
I knew he was crazy.

02:16:52.333 --> 02:16:54.750
At least I wash it.
You don't even wear it.

02:16:54.833 --> 02:16:55.916
Guys, hit him!

02:16:57.041 --> 02:16:58.708
-Hit him!
-Enough now.

02:16:59.166 --> 02:17:01.875
Guys, chill,
and stop fighting unnecessarily.

02:17:04.708 --> 02:17:05.666
Okay, guys.

02:17:06.666 --> 02:17:07.875
I'll go and meet Nikitha.

02:17:58.708 --> 02:17:59.791
What's all this, Nikitha?

02:17:59.958 --> 02:18:01.666
How do we remove this from the internet?

02:18:01.916 --> 02:18:03.166
It has already gone viral.

02:18:03.625 --> 02:18:05.500
Why do you record all this?

02:18:06.375 --> 02:18:08.041
-That's not me--
-What the hell!

02:18:08.541 --> 02:18:10.041
-Dad--
-Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

02:18:10.125 --> 02:18:11.250
-What the hell is all this?
-Please!

02:18:13.166 --> 02:18:14.083
Dad, that's not--

02:18:14.166 --> 02:18:16.916
What? Are you going
to deny that it's you?

02:18:17.041 --> 02:18:18.083
Dad, please!

02:18:23.875 --> 02:18:25.416
One of your ex-lovers is calling you.

02:18:26.041 --> 02:18:26.958
Dad…

02:18:27.791 --> 02:18:30.041
Your ex-lover is calling you!

02:18:36.750 --> 02:18:37.833
To hell with this phone!

02:18:41.416 --> 02:18:45.125
Relatives have started calling me.
What will I tell them?

02:18:45.208 --> 02:18:46.625
Dad! Dad, please!

02:18:49.916 --> 02:18:50.791
Dad!

02:19:18.750 --> 02:19:19.583
Dad…

02:19:19.666 --> 02:19:21.625
I pampered her so that she
doesn't miss her mother…

02:19:21.875 --> 02:19:23.250
but look what she has done!

02:19:24.916 --> 02:19:27.000
She is not my daughter anymore!

02:19:28.708 --> 02:19:31.333
Yes! I failed as a parent!
What's your problem?

02:19:32.375 --> 02:19:34.375
To hell with that groom! Get lost!

02:19:47.125 --> 02:19:49.458
Pradeep, did Nikitha come there?

02:19:50.541 --> 02:19:51.458
Here?

02:19:52.375 --> 02:19:53.250
No.

02:19:53.583 --> 02:19:56.541
Did you… did you see that video?

02:20:00.083 --> 02:20:01.791
All hell has broken loose here.

02:20:02.458 --> 02:20:04.708
Nikitha left the house.

02:20:05.041 --> 02:20:07.125
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

02:20:09.666 --> 02:20:12.166
Can you please return her phone?

02:20:13.166 --> 02:20:14.791
<i>I want to call her friends.</i>

02:20:15.333 --> 02:20:17.208
Wait, we'll call her friends.

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:25.041
Dude, Nikitha is missing.

02:20:28.500 --> 02:20:32.750
Dude, call her friends and find out
if she went to any of their houses.

02:20:32.833 --> 02:20:35.583
If not, tell them to call back
if she visits them.

02:20:37.166 --> 02:20:38.666
I'll go to her house and look around.

02:20:39.208 --> 02:20:40.958
Dude, go and look for her.

02:20:43.125 --> 02:20:43.958
Buddy…

02:20:45.750 --> 02:20:46.750
here, keep my phone.

02:20:46.916 --> 02:20:48.166
I'll call you if she comes here.

02:20:48.750 --> 02:20:49.666
You go ahead, buddy.

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.458
Bro, she might have gone out for a drive.

02:21:16.125 --> 02:21:18.000
She'll be back by morning. Chill.

02:21:25.583 --> 02:21:27.458
I don't care where she is!
Keep me out of this!

02:22:35.958 --> 02:22:37.416
What happened?

02:22:37.500 --> 02:22:41.708
I come here every day to check,
but this tree doesn't seem to sprout.

02:22:43.583 --> 02:22:45.500
-Do you dig it out and check it every day?
-Yes.

02:22:47.333 --> 02:22:48.541
Oh, no.

02:22:48.750 --> 02:22:52.208
If you don't have faith and dig it
out every day, how will it sprout?

02:22:53.250 --> 02:22:56.166
Trust that it will grow,
and don't dig it out again.

02:22:56.375 --> 02:22:57.208
It will grow.

02:22:57.791 --> 02:23:01.083
One week is all we've
got, or else it's over!

02:23:02.625 --> 02:23:05.625
Have faith.

02:24:22.041 --> 02:24:24.625
Look at me.

02:24:25.541 --> 02:24:26.375
Hey…

02:24:26.458 --> 02:24:28.250
I said, look at me.

02:24:29.208 --> 02:24:30.083
Look at me.

02:24:30.416 --> 02:24:33.333
Pradeep, I swear I didn't do it.

02:24:37.833 --> 02:24:38.666
I trust you!

02:24:38.916 --> 02:24:44.916
<i>You and I are the epitome of love</i>

02:24:45.416 --> 02:24:52.083
<i>I don't care what the world says</i>
<i>I will always trust you</i>

02:24:55.791 --> 02:24:57.416
Nikitha,
even I didn't send those messages.

02:24:57.583 --> 02:24:58.416
I know.

02:24:59.208 --> 02:25:00.083
How?

02:25:01.250 --> 02:25:04.708
I know you're not that type of person.
That's it.

02:25:11.583 --> 02:25:13.583
Nikitha, I thought I knew you very well…

02:25:14.958 --> 02:25:16.250
but I know zilch!

02:25:18.541 --> 02:25:19.791
I realized something though.

02:25:21.166 --> 02:25:22.625
That I'm madly in love with you.

02:25:24.708 --> 02:25:25.916
Madly?

02:25:26.541 --> 02:25:27.541
Yes, madly!

02:25:27.833 --> 02:25:29.916
Madly!

02:25:32.500 --> 02:25:35.000
I had a perception
about the girl I'd fall in love with.

02:25:36.458 --> 02:25:39.750
Well, the perception is true,
but I want it to be you.

02:25:41.166 --> 02:25:42.750
I can't imagine anyone
else in your place.

02:25:48.541 --> 02:25:51.125
I am sincerely sorry if I hurt you.

02:25:54.458 --> 02:25:55.833
I love you, Pradeep.

02:25:56.375 --> 02:25:57.666
Don't you worry.

02:25:58.958 --> 02:26:02.333
Do you know how embarrassed I am?

02:26:02.750 --> 02:26:04.083
Don't worry. I am here for you.

02:26:04.291 --> 02:26:06.833
Even my dad didn't believe me.

02:26:08.666 --> 02:26:09.583
I am here for you.

02:26:10.750 --> 02:26:11.791
Dude, I got him!

02:26:15.250 --> 02:26:16.916
That's him!

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:35.708
Nikitha is not the girl in that video.

02:26:36.958 --> 02:26:38.166
This is the real unadulterated video.

02:26:39.125 --> 02:26:42.208
I morphed Nikitha's face in this
using the Deep Fake software.

02:26:43.708 --> 02:26:45.500
I did this because I get a kick
out of making such videos trend.

02:26:46.166 --> 02:26:48.375
I didn't expect the impact
would be so huge.

02:26:54.625 --> 02:26:55.666
My guilt is killing me now.

02:26:56.750 --> 02:26:58.666
That girl is innocent. Please forgive me.

02:26:58.750 --> 02:27:04.916
<i>Even if you leave me and go away</i>
<i>I'll come for you and fight for our love</i>

02:27:05.333 --> 02:27:06.583
I had told you.

02:27:09.208 --> 02:27:10.625
I had told you!

02:27:12.208 --> 02:27:15.833
-Tell us!
-Why did you do this?

02:27:16.458 --> 02:27:17.625
How did you trap him?

02:27:17.833 --> 02:27:20.416
First, I tracked the phone in
which the source video was stored.

02:27:20.875 --> 02:27:22.125
I sent a bait link to that phone.

02:27:22.333 --> 02:27:23.333
He clicked on the bait…

02:27:24.333 --> 02:27:25.166
and I nabbed him!

02:27:27.375 --> 02:27:28.250
What is it?

02:27:28.916 --> 02:27:31.416
Well, I thought you'd be dead.

02:27:31.916 --> 02:27:32.875
Come again!

02:27:33.416 --> 02:27:35.416
I thought you'd be dead.

02:27:35.875 --> 02:27:38.041
-Wait and watch, you'll be dead now!
-Okay.

02:27:38.125 --> 02:27:40.000
-Sorry.
-Tribal pics? Really?

02:27:40.166 --> 02:27:42.208
Let me check who all
you got such pics from!

02:27:42.500 --> 02:27:45.416
-What?
-Quiet. Don't talk.

02:27:50.958 --> 02:27:57.375
<i>You are more precious to me</i>
<i>Than my life</i>

02:27:57.750 --> 02:28:03.125
<i>No matter how many births I take</i>
<i>I will ensure you are mine</i>

02:28:03.333 --> 02:28:07.625
Twenty years ago, only one out of
ten couples would end up marrying.

02:28:09.125 --> 02:28:10.708
The rest of them would be
separated by their parents.

02:28:13.125 --> 02:28:16.041
The numbers are the same today…

02:28:16.375 --> 02:28:19.416
but now, parents don't separate
the couple. You guys do it yourselves.

02:28:22.916 --> 02:28:26.500
I didn't do this so that you both
would fight and break up.

02:28:27.333 --> 02:28:30.916
I did it to see if you both are willing
to make things work no matter what.

02:28:33.541 --> 02:28:35.083
Buddy, thanks for coming.

02:28:35.583 --> 02:28:37.000
Now, get lost. No feast for you.

02:28:40.125 --> 02:28:42.125
Can I have your phone for a moment?

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:56.875
What?

02:29:01.291 --> 02:29:03.458
<i>It's not a sin to check</i>
<i>your life partner's phone…</i>

02:29:03.583 --> 02:29:05.416
<i>but have trust in them!</i>

02:29:06.416 --> 02:29:08.541
Even I slipped a bit.

02:29:12.666 --> 02:29:13.583
Sorry, dear.

02:29:15.333 --> 02:29:16.375
But you were spot on!

02:29:17.166 --> 02:29:18.041
I am convinced.

02:29:19.375 --> 02:29:20.625
So, when are you bringing
your mother here?

02:29:23.125 --> 02:29:29.041
<i>We both are the epitome of love</i>

02:29:29.583 --> 02:29:31.708
<i>No matter what others say</i>

02:29:31.791 --> 02:29:34.833
<i>Don't break down, dear</i>
<i>Because I trust you</i>

02:29:34.916 --> 02:29:36.333
<i>I stopped and thought for a moment.</i>

02:29:36.916 --> 02:29:38.291
<i>When was the last time I was at peace?</i>

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:40.416
<i>It was when I trusted</i>
<i>everybody around me.</i>

02:29:41.166 --> 02:29:42.500
<i>Then, what's stopping us</i>
<i>from trusting others?</i>

02:29:42.916 --> 02:29:46.458
<i>If they deceive us, then they'll be</i>
<i>the ones who lose their inner peace.</i>

02:29:47.083 --> 02:29:48.208
<i>Why should we lose our inner peace?</i>

02:29:48.875 --> 02:29:50.083
<i>One question remained unanswered.</i>

02:29:50.375 --> 02:29:53.291
<i>Who sent vulgar messages</i>
<i>to Nikitha and her sister?</i>

02:29:53.875 --> 02:29:55.125
<i>We don't know that yet.</i>

02:29:55.333 --> 02:29:58.375
<i>But that person also lives among us.</i>

02:29:59.125 --> 02:30:02.500
<i>It's scary, but there are many</i>
<i>kindhearted people out there.</i>

02:30:03.250 --> 02:30:04.291
<i>We just need to have some faith.</i>

02:30:25.583 --> 02:30:29.541
The kids have got to know
each other very well.

02:30:29.958 --> 02:30:32.541
So, before we get them engaged…

02:30:35.250 --> 02:30:37.291
how about we swap our mobiles?
